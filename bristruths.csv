So I'm looking to rent in Bristol and wondered is anyone had used Romans before? As a fourth year I've never come across them before so could do with some reviews.

Also, any other tea or praise for other letting agents in Bristol wouldn't go amiss either.

Please leave your wisdom in the comments xxxx",0,0

I’m having a generally shit time with people I don’t know, can’t trust, and people who make me, a normally cheery individual, feel like completely awful about myself. My parents and I have found a one bed flat but I’m worried moving out on my own will make things worse. I feel I would be missing out on so much if I do life and on top of that, if we go into lockdown I’ll be in my own. The other option would be to move back home as most of my classes are online...

Bristol hotels are all booked up by sophisticated professionals who somehow managed to get their high flying job with a degree over the internet, and thanks to COVID where it killed all the oldies, and all the senior positions were made vacant. Those 3 years of being locked in a flat were worth it to be back in Bristol and ready for the reopening of The Lounge (renamed Lizalo- oooh trendy).

You waltz up to Clifton triangle- queues and queues of people swarm around, all of which have the noticeable crows feet & you think ‘my people. This is where I belong’ as you line up to LizaLo (‘shit name’ you say to your peers). You enter and walk down the steps- you can feel the sweat drip down off the ceiling onto your face, and notice the people attempting to dance in such a confined space. You order some drinks including a few jaegars: ‘shot, shots, shots’ chant the club. You buy shots for everyone, you get paralytic, you do lines off people’s body parts, you smoke indoors, there’s an orgy going on in the corner- there are no rules any longer... Yet you still end up throwing up in the toilet- ‘tactical chunder’ you think as you head to the bar, grab a few more shots, dance some more and get with a few more people. The night is a blur. You vaguely remember walking down the road to takka takka. You somehow get an Uber and make it back to the penthouse. You crawl into bed and close your eyes feeling your heart beat rapidly ‘ahh, this is the end’ you think sweetly as you drift off into unconsciousness.

Head is pounding. I’ll spare you the details but much drinking was done, with no dancing to metabolise it, so I woke up drunk and its now 12pm and I have a lecture in an hour.
En-route to the shower I hoovered up some rice krispies, these have been the soundtrack to my morning as people crunch them with their shoes, enough was enough and this shall be my good deed of the day.
Breakout room was, for the first time, not awkward because we all had something to talk about, you guessed it - isolation. Instead of comparing translations we compared the state of quarantines in our respective flats.
Had a friends’ debrief around 5 to discuss the events of last night, not to be disclosed, use your imagination (or don’t).
5:23 all 28 (yeah there's that many of us) of our doors are being used as percussion instruments in what I can only describe as sounding like a cult summoning. Turns out dinner is being announced. Frankly a gong would achieve the same thing in half the amount of time, even if that is still cultish.
7:30 Flat call with the lovely resi-life rep: Bilbo Baggins (an alias for obvious reasons). Probably the most entertaining collaborate call known to a student. One guy was blinded by his strobe light and nearly fell off his bed; flatcests were outed and the rice krispies culprits were, seemingly, identified. The message chat became a savage playground and BB actively ignored ‘good shag?’.
8:30 sipping on a Fosters while I catch up on the farcical show that is our current government. Coming to terms with the fact that once I get out of this isolation I may only be able to go to a pub if they serve pasties with chips and a side salad. I’m already looking at menus in preparation.
10:30 thought I would get an early night, aka start watching shows early, have gone for Defending the Guilty. The prison footage is not dissimilar from the current state of my hallway so it's somewhat relatable.",33,1

133,#Bristruth30520,"Right literally noone asked but as a scientist I simply had to. I present my findings from a recent study which I spent far too much time and money on.

A systematic review comparing a spectrum of Oat milks available in UK supermarkets covering price (on a scale of $-$$$), texture and flavour.

*Most milks bought, where possible, were unsweetened Oat milks.*

From the most expensive to least:

Oatly- 9/10 $$$
The OG. The real reason why I love oat milk. Creamy. Froths up beautifully and not too sweet.

Minor Figures- 9/10 $$$
Slightly too thin but tastes amazing in coffee! Doesn't froth up great but would be my go to option if I was boujee.

Asda own brand- 8/10 $
Surprisingly good! Creamy so is a great texture. Only thing holding it back from reaching its true potential is the fact that it tastes like liquid sugar. Needs to chill out on the sweetness but grest for the price point.

Alpro- 7/10 $$
Made mediocre Masala Chai so I have some pent up sadness associated with this which has admittedly clouded my judgement. Ignoring this trauma it was actually alright, again it was just too sweet but on the plus side it is basically always on offer in the supermarket.

Homemade- 6/10 $
This was a real curve ball but needed inorder to achieve a real and balanced scientific review. Super super cheap- oats, water, agave + a few cashews for some fats. Grest texture but naturally didnt last as long and lacked a bit in my tea.

Lidl own brand- 6/10 $
Really not bad at all! Super affordable. Slightly too thin but honestly at the price that it is and the fact that I've had worse, this does the job okay. Also provides an excuse to go to the Lidl bakery so 👀

Aldi own brand (with additives)- 4/10 $
*tyra banks: WE WERE ROOTING FOR YOU*
Honestly I wished, I really wish this was better. I am just deeply upset that its not better. Thin and far far too sweet.

Aldi own brand (just oat and water)- 1/10 $
Dont mean to be a hater because I stan the aldi soy milk. But it was so thin I was like I was adding water to my tea rather than milk.

Plenish- -50/10 $$$
The worst thing ive ever put my self through needing to drink. Costs about one kidney per carton and is generally just the worst. It is like water and tastes bitter. I would literally sue if i could be bothered, and I wrote this so I am clearly committee. Avoid at all costs 🙅🏾‍♀️",148,76

Woke up to the cleaner screaming about our rubbish being all over the place in the staircase, she has my greatest sympathy - its disgusting - only problem is we are not allowed to leave to take the rubbish out so somewhat of a catch 22.
First thing on the agenda, trawl through the food parcels we have been given. Separate into potential meal, edible, starvation rations and no way.
Following a general sort of my room, after all this is my living space for another 15 days so needs to feel a little zen, its time to log onto my seminar. Blackboard chucked me off three times, each time when I turned on the camera. Can’t help but think the universe is severely judging my isolation appearance (rolled out of bed and whacked on the same pair of trackies).
Its now 1pm and I realised catering did actually deliver breakfast, halfway up the stairs. Cold bacon baps anyone? Food poisoning to garnish the covid? - I’ll pass.
Got through some reading while simultaneously watching every Dolly Alderton interview I could find.
Its 5:30 and dinner has arrived, they are trying their best, but again I shall pass and instead opt for one of the emergency food parcel concoctions. I have been enjoying peanut butter on crackers and a few raisins, Michelin star oú t’es?
7pm, my favourite part of the day, crack open a (warm because the fridge is overflowing more than a Primark jumper stand) beer. The drinking begins and with it the day’s lack of stimulation washes away.

At 1pm, a glass jar of crunchy Aldi peanut butter was found - unwashed- in the general waste bin rather than the recycling where is belongs. No one will own up to the deed so we want to leave it up to Bristruths to decide who gets the blame. Forensics found that the peanut butter was consumed with a knife and was placed at the scene somewhere between the hours of 10am and 1pm. Names have been removed to protect suspect identities.

The peanut butter in question: https://www.aldi.co.uk/wholenut-crunchy-peanut-butter/p/074077328892200

Suspect #1 - found the peanut butter and is a fierce enforcer of recycling rules. Furious about the misplacement of the peanut butter and determined to find out who did it

Suspect #2 - very suspiciously giggling throughout the investigation. Pinky promised it was not him and that he does not buy peanut butter

Suspect #3 - a buyer of Aldi peanut butter. Found in her cupboard was a half full jar of a different Aldi brand. Always eats it with a spoon which contradicts the knife marks. Would not leave that much peanut butter to waste

Suspect #4 - eats peanut butter with a spoon and does not shop at Aldi. Only purchases Whole Earth peanut butter and has a half full jar in her cupboard

Suspect #5 - very little information. Does shop at Aldi but does not own peanut butter. Would consume if desperate and is running low on food supplies

Suspect #6 - frequent Aldi shopper and owner of peanut butter. Adamant that it was not him but found in his cupboard was a fresh jar of smooth Aldi peanut butter

Suspect #7 - was not in the house at the time of binning. Very little information regarding peanut butter consumption habits

Suspect #8 - deeply opposed to peanut butter

1. Wear an oversized top (with or without a logo depending if you're going for the common or posh edgy look)
2. Get some wavy garms (we're talking bright, colourful slightly baggy clothes that everyone loves to hate)
3. Pop down to your nearest charity shop (thrift shop if you're from across the pond) and buy some vintage, retro clothing e.g. 80-90s jacket etc.
4. If you're a girl wear some flares otherwise wear baggy trousers (cargo trousers, jeans, cords etc)
5. Underneath your oversized top wear another long-sleeved oversized top underneath to complete the look
6. Change your hairstyle (again we're thinking 80s or 90s so for guys curtains and mullets are ideal or a full buzz cut is a good alternative)
7. Invest in the biggest puffer jacket you can find with a street brand like north face (bigger is better)
8. Start smoking/and doing drugs so that your lifestyle matches the look (disclaimer vaping is not the one when it comes to being edgy)
9. If you've got long hair wear a hat/beanie over the top for the sk8er boi look (skater boys are the ultimate edgelords)
10. Start speaking like an edgelord, which means using roadmen slang like 'peak' and 'g' in every day talk (but make sure you don't become a chav)
11. Start liking drum and bass and alternative/indie music and going to clubs like lakota and blue mountain (and obviously hang out in the smoking areas as often as possible to flex your edginess)

You may walk past Lola Lo these days with a deep sadness in your heart, longing to walk down into that tropical paradise once more. You may crave the club's sweet smell, may yearn for the exotic decor. But for me the opposite is true.

I notice the dark neon light that once glowed flourescent pink and I smile. Not from a deep nostalgia but from a sense of completion. A two year journey which started with a strong love, but then riddled with betrayal and anguish, has finally ended.

It's likely I will never visit Lola Lo again. This is a thought that brings me no joy nor sorrow yet I am fulfilled. There is no longer any need to pursue the place I once loved.

*Now with a bonus category, music!*

2) Caffè Nero (Beacon House)

Another day, another café. One of the better known cafés among the student population, this Caffe Nero is located by Beacon House. Coming to Nero must be timed well. Being unable to see free tables around the corner turns a trip to Nero into a frantic search for somewhere to sit, akin to the feeling of desperately trying to find your lecture in the Queens Building when you were a fresher. If you time it wrong and buy your coffee around lunchtime, then its already game over for you. Kiss that study space goodbye.

Aesthetic: 6/10. Again, falling into the trap of bulbs dangling like old ballsacks, Caffe Nero adopts the classic city café design. Unlike other places, however, the trimmings are not to the best quality as the cable management is messy, and the ceiling looks unfinished.

Coffee Quality: 6/10. It’s commonly known that chain coffee isn’t the best. It’s definitely not the worst, but when you pay an above average price, you expect an above average brew.

Customer Levels: 6/10. Being in a prime student location, the café itself tends to be filled with 6th-formers on their break ‘working’, and middle-aged women discussing their adventure into the menopause.

Lighting: 9/10. I’m personally a big fan of the warm lighting scheme throughout the building. Well done, Nero!

Tables: 7/10. Not overly large, but they’re nice and sturdy. Ideal for laptops and a notebook to be used simultaneously.

Location: 8/10. Opposite the Beacon House U1 stop, Caffe Nero is in a prime location for freshers. A little harder for those living in Clifton and Redland to get to, but perfect for accessing university facilities.

Price: 4/10. £3.25 for a Mocha of average quality is like paying £9k for a BB Degree. Oh wait…

Music: 8/10. Plays some nice orchestral music, along with some lesser known funk. Pretty good stuff to focus your mind.

Overall Rating: 6.75/10. Decent place to study, but don’t expect great coffee.",52,7

1) Number Fifty Café (Whiteladies Rd)
This is a new café that replaced the ‘Mary Jane’ CBD café after it collapsed at the start of lockdown. As you enter you’re met with the classic ‘rustic café’ vibe that many places seem to adopt; wooden tables, metallic chairs and trimmings, dangling light bulbs… Very nicely designed nonetheless.
The tables are quite annoying, they stand as steady as a girl in the queue for a Donnervans on a Friday night out (RIP), but other than that the Coffee is great, and strong enough to give you that well needed boost of will-to-live.

Aesthetic: 7/10. Looks pretty nice but falls into the classic café design trap. Dangling light bulbs are almost as bad as freshers thinking LED light strips are ‘vibes’ and ‘alt’.

Coffee Quality: 10/10. Ordered a Mocha, got a very good Mocha! Their coffee is a very nice natural Ethiopian roast, and the balance of chocolate to coffee is perfect. Plus, the barista makes cool swan coffee art.

Customer Levels: 8/10. Pretty nice balance of people. Not too many that it feels crowded, not too few so that all eyes are on you.

Lighting: 7/10. Aside from the light bulbs, the lighting is actually pretty good. A large amount of natural sunlight comes in through a large ceiling window.

Tables: 5/10. Most of the tables wobble, and many are only just big enough for a laptop and notes.

Location: 7/10. Just down from Clifton Down along Whiteladies, this is fairly easy to get to from most places (Redland, Clifton, Even Stokey B). Bicycle parking out the front is also very useful.

Price: 7/10. £3.20 for a mocha. Seems to be the going rate.

Overall Rating: 7.29/10. Really great place to go for coffee, and a pretty good place to go to study too.",182,26

I want to help you (as well as myself) to connect to others in the same shoes. As this is a sensitive issue, I'll provide this form below so that you can register without letting anybody know. I'll connect you to other supplementary year students, preferably from the same course, and hopefully you'll make new friends to get through this hard time together.

349,#Bristruth30306,"*Disclaimer:* the following opinion covers UK fees only.

Your student debt has never been and will never be 'crippling' in any way. The way you pay for university is much more akin to a graduate tax than a loan. With any regular loan, you have regular fixed interest payments as well as the capital repayment that will have to be returned at some point. Your monthly/yearly repayments have to be made irrespective of how much you earn. This is fundamentally different to they way student loan repayments work.

With your student loan, you pay off a (very affordable) percentage of your salary, that progressively increases as your earnings do in the same way as virtually all other taxes. For most people this is 9% of your earnings over £21k. This means that you should never NOT be able to afford the payments. If you are made redundant and have no income for several years - you will pay £0 on student loan repayments. Your student loan will not have any impact on your credit rating and will not affect your ability to borrow money in the future. In this way it is just another tax on earnings; it does not behave like a loan. The 'write off' of the loan after 30 years is just you no longer having to pay this tax.

Don't get me wrong - the system is flawed. But I believe it is flawed far more in the way it is presented as a 'loan' and a 'debt' than in the amount you actually have to repay - whether we should have to pay for education at all is another argument entirely. People with expendable cash during the 30 years repayment period (eg. from inheritance) can and often do pay off a lump sum of their student loan. Unless they are very high earners, this is usually money down the drain, and is only done due to the impression of being under huge amounts of debt.

TLDR: it's a tax, not a debt, and most certainly not crippling.",124,7

Response to *uni should always be free*.
I'll preface this by saying a) I think it is awful we are paying full price this year and b) I am not saying 9k is necessarily a price... however...

Uni's get the majority of their funding from student fees, so if the experience was free they would have to find this money elsewhere. I'm guessing you're suggesting it comes from the government (please correct me if you're not). So taxes would have to increase (or money diverted from elsewhere) meaning rather than the education just being paid for by those who go to uni it will also be funded by those who choose not to go and will be at the expense of another sector.

Uni graduates tend to get paid better so it does seem reasonable it comes out of our pockets rather than from the taxpayer.

Also small point: at what point does free education extend to? Post grad as well? can I do multiple degrees for free?

I have passed this feedback on directly to SEH and have just received a response from them.

They said that:

""In order to increase the capacity of the gym a number of pieces of equipment were moved, including the matted area from the upstairs gym which is now in Studio 3. Unfortunately, we experienced problems with the alarm system, which meant that Studio 3 was temporarily unavailable. Studio 3 is now open – and we have been able to increase the size of the matted area available to gym users. We want to make sure that everybody has a safe space to complete their workout, regardless of the activity that they are doing.""

I hope that this provides some clarity as to why the matted area was temporarily unavailable.

Additionally, if there is any other feedback that you have in the future, please feel free to contact SEH directly at seh-enquiries@bristol.ac.uk so that it can be actioned and you can be informed of the reason/response regarding your feedback.",4,0

My course was postgraduate research, miles away down the road in an NHS building and the whole thing was a shit show from day 1. Nothing about the course was explained to me by my own supervisor, I wasn't told I had a viva, my Nan died in January and I wasn't offered extenuating circumstances, in fact my supervisor told me to 'hurry up' on the way home from viewing my Nans body at the funeral centre, because I had an experiment to run with them... when I got to uni, they werent even there. My supervisor also told me I have to do '9-5' hours, even when I had nothing to do in the lab and work better from home... I was basically treated as a slave to churn papers out for their lab and treated as an employee or phd student, when I'm not. Fast forward 9 months and I think I'm finally done with this fucking nightmare of a masters, I go to submit the dissertation and follow instructions on screen. Thinking I’d handed it in, I prep for my viva, only to be told 2 weeks later by my supervisor that my diss never got submitted cos I didnt follow 'all the instructions and there was one other I had to do'?!?!?! (it never said that anywhere on the submission page as I even got my partner to read it). Long story short, my viva was supposed to be this week and now has to be pushed back to a date I don't even have yet, baring in mind I’ve started my phd in another city now. anyone else had an experience like this???? The whole thing is just a joke, hated it since day 1 and it wont bloody end :((((",27,14
492,#Bristruth30163,"Okay so seeing all these “why are people complaining over online teaching” posts let me explain:
1. Some of us traveled from half the world for university. And yes we are paying more than UK students and yes we were aware of that. BUT! Through the last months Uni talked about blended learning. It’s not blended if you don’t have any face to face teaching! That’s called online only. And I’m not willing to pay for an online only course.
2. As said before we traveled from different countries. We had to pay for visa, flights, transportation in general! We are tied to rental contracts now! This is not cheap. And it is unnecessary because our modules are online! And those “once every other week labs” aren’t cutting it! I won’t be missing out on anything if I don’t attend those 3 lab sessions!
3. We are far away from home, tied to contracts, living in a foreign country! Some of us are away from home for the very first time and it’s not easy for some of us to make friends like that! It’s a different culture, we might not feel confident enough to talk yet! Where is the support for students? Very few societies are operating normally, barely any face to face teaching, hardly any access to uni facilities. Ever thought about how this affects students wellbeing? And don’t tell me call night line or well-being services at uni this is not going to help when anxiety levels are so high!
4. This is not getting our money’s worth at all. We were lead on to think we will have face to face teaching which isn’t happening, they promised to open uni facilities and now reduced library sessions to 4 hours a week! We are PAYING for those facilities!
5. Don’t tell me it’s for the safety of others! Expanding gym sessions and access where people sweat together, using the same equipment, walking around but closing uni facilities like libraries where people sit down to study is not logical!? And no it’s not for our safety! Am I the only one who sees this?!
I could go on with this list but I assume this is enough to begin with. This my friends is called taking advantage of students. Look at Glasgow or Manchester. How is this government going to excuse the mistreatment of students?!",236,7

Yes having preferences is fine.
However I have seen girls express this preference casually and not as a deal-breaker if the guy is really great.
On the other hand, I have seen countless women judged, belittled and dehumanised for factors such as their weight. Assumptions are made on their whole character and it's seen as irredeemable and a deal-breaker before even talking to her.

Women are not socialised against men in the same way. If you are shorter than her usual type but have lots of other redeeming features chances are she'll get over it.

Furthermore, broadly speaking, when women are not into a guy who is generally very nice and they do at least like as person. They tend to be kinder and apologetic about it. Unless it's actually happened in person where a girl has said coldly and unkindly ""I don't want to date you because you're shorter than *insert height*"" rather than just a tongue in cheek thing in a tinder bio then I struggle to sympathise. Because I know so many women that have unkind and rude things said directly to them about their bodies with no consideration for their feelings.

Unrealistic body expectations are always unhealthy but there hasn't been centuries of patriarchy and colonisation telling men they have to look a certain way and that they'll be dehumanised if they don't conform to it. And of course I don't wish those expectations on men in any way but it's not the same, there is not the same weight behind women's preferences as there are for men's.

This is kind of long but tldr: trying to equate the harmful socialisation and expectations placed on the way woman look in society in general to a vague preference some women have about height is reductive and unfair.",86,3

Yes, some students can be loud and obnoxious, but that still doesn't excuse the constant scapegoating students as a whole receive.

For every one loud, disruptive student, there a dozen just living normal uni lives. These students cause no trouble whatsoever, but are still blamed for issues like rubbish, vandalism and rudeness, often with zero evidence.

Even worse, despite paying ever-steepening rent costs, often for incredibly rundown apartments, uni students are still seen as ""lesser"" residents overall. Students contribute so much to a city's economy, but are looked down on in favour of ""real"" residents and homeowners.

Long story short: saying ""uni students suck as neighbours"" is an unfair and incorrect generalisation. It's a bad take and you should feel bad.",116,0

Top tier: Wales, most original, only one without 'land' at the end, name also sounds like my favourite sea dwelling creature, flag has a dragon on it, the fact it was willing to be so far down in an alphabetical list makes it BDE.
Great tier: Scotland, 'land' lets it down but otherwise a solid choice, only one where the name of the people is actually in the name of the country so it makes sense, also very fun to say in a Scottish accent. Trademark the word scot, give me 10% royalties from all sales of scotch and you're god tier
Ok Tier: England, how 'anglosaxons' became England idk, but it is also very funny to say in an English accent. Flag is BORING, would be top great tier if they inverted the colour scheme (I know thats denmark shut up what will they do about it), rename England Britain and leave the union and it's god tier.
Shit Tier: NI, literally identifies itself by the fact it is the north of another country which it isn't even fully north of, no 'official' flag, very poor strategy for branding as all good countries have good flags (observe the bold swedish flag), poor form northern ireland step up your game, your unofficial flag is scary AND I LIKE THAT, make it your official flag and you'll top the list.",67,27

The artisinal: Owns at least 4 different instruments for coffee making, probably has 'a supplier' who hooks them up, judges everyone else's coffee tastes, actually knows the difference between a single and double roast, will only ever go for dates at reputable hipster coffee establishments. Wouldn't be seen dead in a starbucks
The caffeine head: Drinks any brand as long as there's a high amount of caffeine, less than three tablespoons of instant in a morning cup might as well be decafe, is the only person to ever get value for money for the unlimited coffee by going up at least times, occasionally disassociates because of it. Wouldn't be caught dead in a costa, prefers greggs because of their size.
The fake caffeine head: Claims to be a caffeine head but can't handle anything stronger than a teaspoon of instant, complains about 'caffeine withdrawel headaches' after a month of drinking decafe, only ever orders mocha's in cafe's. Wouldn't be caught dead outside of a starbucks, needs a ratio of 100:1 whipped cream:caffeine
The Moderate: Actually normal with their coffee drinking, has one cup in the morning with breakfast after a good nights sleep, doesn't talk about coffee at all, probably owns a machine or caffetiere but doesn't brag about it, most functional of them all, doesn't drink coffee after 10am. Wouldn't be caught dead buying some weird bat poo coffee
The Party animal: Exclusively drinks cold coffee from tesco express after a raging night out, still legally drunk at noon. Looks pretty dead in a 9am.
The Pill popper: Takes caffeine pills for some reason, placebo affect kicks in and they think their dependent after 3 days, doesn't actually drink coffee despite that being infinitely healthier, probably the one person most likely to not actually need the caffeine boost. Would not be caught dead inside a pharmacy actually buying them, always gets them off a friend for free somehow.",49,39

Strange Things characters ranked from worst to best: (WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS)

13. Jonathan Byers – While I definitely shipped his and Nancy’s relationship from the start we must not forget the fact that his hobbies include taking pictures of people without their knowledge … creepy. Defo lost some cool points there. Not to mention that after season 1 his character doesn’t see much development making him one of the more forgettable characters of the season.

12. Nancy Wheeler – While she definitely has some pretty badass moments, in general her storyline isn’t that interesting. Especially in season 3 where they randomly make this character interested in journalism. ???

11. Billy- Ah Billy…If he hadn’t been a total psychopath until the very last minute, I would have ranked him higher. I must admit Dacre Montgomery’s acting was superb, how he actually got us to sympathize for a character who literally runs kids over for fun I’ll never know. Also, he’s hella hot.

10. Will Byers – While, yes admittedly the show wouldn’t exist without him, he didn’t have much screen time in the first season and I do feel like, no offence, he just doesn’t have as much personality or flavour as the other characters in the group. Sorry, not sorry.

9. Mike Wheeler– Him and Eleven are beyond Adorable. However, he can act pretty selfishly at times and get pissed off at people (ahem Max) for literally no reason.

8. Lucas Sinclair – He was annoying in season 1 but definitely redeemed himself in later seasons. He’s a pretty good friend and definitely has his moment of genius at the end of season 3.

7. Jim Hopper – Our hero. Hopper is definitely one of the funniest and bravest in the series and I do not lie when I say I balled my eyes out during the letter scene. Unfortunately, he loses points of being an asshole for most of season 3.

6. Max- This girl is as cool as it gets. She’s badass, she doesn’t care what people think and she’s an awesome best friend to Eleven. Actually, if Eleven didn’t have superpowers Max would probably be cooler than her too.

5. Eleven – Everyone in the show would be dead without this girl. Absolute badass.

4. Joyce Byers- Mum GOALS. She’s kind she’s caring she always knows what to say and while everyone else always thinks she’s crazy (magnets anyone?) she doesn't care. In the end, she's always right anyways! Also, her kids ALWAYS come first.

3. Erica Sinclair – She’s sassy and super funny, a natural fit for Steve Dustin and Robin’s group in season 3. What’s not to love? HER HIGHLIGHTS: Murray: ""I'm sorry, why is this 4-year-old speaking to me?"" he asks. ERICA- ""I'm 10, you bald bastard""

2. Dustin – He’s funny, energetic and his toothless smile is just downright adorable. His friendship with Steve makes those two the ultimate duo. Not to mention that the singing scene with his girlfriend who turned out to be real, Suzie, was definitely the funniest and most iconic moment of the season.

1. Steve Harrington- MOMMA STEVE. Talk about character development. He went from the person you hope dies in the series to the person you hope never dies. Him adopting the gang is the best thing that happened to the show. I swear, if they kill momma Steve, I WILL delete my Netflix subscription.

Honourable mention –
Bob – Superhero Bob. I really thought this guy was gonna turn out to be a dick. Proved us wrong. He brings out Joyce’s nerdier side and is sweeter than a doughnut. Wish he’d stuck around longer so I could put him on the official list.",53,3

If not, would there be an interest for something like this. Lack of nice clothes is something that I have struggled with over the past two years and have found myself at firm presentations where I feel really low in confidence because of this.

581,#Bristruth29516,"A note about my own privilege.

First things first, I do not now, nor have ever, considered myself bigoted in anyway. If you'd asked me what I thought about equality when I was 4 or 14 or 24 I'd have given you similar answers, although hopefully advancing a little over that time. The events I'm about to list, the things I've said and done, I did not consider prejudiced at the time. It is only through personal growth and education that I can look back now and see how they were wrong. Almost everyone has been guilty of this at one point or another. Those saying they haven't are either one in a million, lying to themselves because they can't face the truth, or just plainly still bigotted.

I feel that at the moment, with everything that is happening, it is more important than ever to recognise our own (often sub-concious) prejudices and privileges. So here goes. Here are some of the ones I have been guilty of, some of which I've only now recently considered.

""That's so gay"" was, for quite some time, the go to insult to use in my experience of primary and early secondary school. I used the word gay as an insult on many occasions. To me, it never meant homosexual. I thought the meaning had changed over time. I was wrong.
This is a privilege I hold through being 'straight'. I've never had to worry about telling my friends and family who I really was. I've never had to hide who I was in love with. I've never had to hide part of myself.
I'm sorry.

I've used sexist insults. I've used certain insults more about women than about men.
This is a privilege I hold through being a man. I've never had to worry about walking through a deserted place late at night. I've never had to think hard about how what I wore would be judged by other people. I've never had to be scared that my voice and ideas would go unheard in a group, simply because of what was between my legs.
I'm sorry.

I've been guilty of not considering my privilege when it comes to race. I've been at a work Christmas do on premises when it was closed to the public. A black man came up and stood outside. I went outside to tell him we were closed. He said ""I know"" and so I asked what he was doing there. I would have done the exact same to anyone, regardless of race. But I was guilty of not understanding how what I said may come across.
This is a privilege I hold through being white. I've never been asked what I was doing simply because I was standing around. I've never been interrogated by the police for doing absolutely nothing. I've never had to fear for my life simply because of the colour of my skin.
I'm sorry.

I've been guilty of being rude to taxi drivers. I've been in rushes and gotten annoyed when the destination has been misunderstood.
This is a privilige I hold through living in a country thats language is my first. I've never been shouted at to leave the country, simply for the language I was talking in. I've never been attacked for speaking to a friend. I've never been looked down upon for not being born in the country I am in.
I'm sorry.

I've dismissed older peoples views, simply because they were older.
This is a privilege I hold through being young. I've never had to worry about being mocked or patronised or ignored, simply because of my age.
I'm sorry.

I've used ableist language. When I was growing up ""that's so gay"" was probably on par with ""that's so retarded"" as the go to insult.
This is a privilige I hold through not being physically or mentally disabled. I've never had to worry about accessing a building that others could freely access. I've never had to worry about not being taken seriously, due to a speech impediment or hearing issue. I've never had to go through being asked to explain a traumatic story of how I became disabled to someone I barely know.
I'm sorry.

I've participated in jokes about all of the above and more. I've told them and laughed at them with friends. Yes, they were jokes. Yes, my friends and I all knew none of us really prescribed to those viewpoints. Yes, I thought that meant it was OK. I was wrong.
This is a privilige I hold through being a young, straight, white, able-bodied, male atheist. I have never been discriminated against based on anything. I have no idea what it's like, or what billions of people go through in this world on a daily basis. And I'm so sorry for my ignorance. I consider myself an ally, above all else. I have for some time now. I have made mistakes. Yes, I was much younger, but this is no excuse.

All we can do is fight to be better. To recognise our priviliges, our prejudices and our mistakes and then fight to create a society where they no longer exist.
Most people in the West hold some form of privilege. Be it from being white, male, straight, not-disabled, young, Christian or atheist. Many people hold multiple privileges as they are members of more than one of these groups. We MUST recognise these.
We must see when they are being taken advantage of, both by ourselves and others, from the past, present and future.
Only then can we begin to drive them away, and truly make the world a fairer, more loving and more beautiful society.",164,1

583,#Bristruth29489,"#Bristruth29416
The university sending an email to show their support for BLM is better than them staying silent. We'd say they were exercising their privilege by not making a stance for the movement. In fact, you saying that it's hypocritical that they're showing support because the university was built off the slave trade can be applied to a lot of people that show their support today. I don't think those people or the university today want to be the benefactors of the slave trade, unfortunately they just are and they're moving in the right direction to do something about it.

And yes, they probably can and should do more, but that's a different argument. I'm just defending people who are at least acting positively for the movement; they shouldn't be attacked, they should be encouraged.

To feel sympathy for this man is honestly just evidence that you’ve completely neglected the news and choose to be blind to every fatal mistake that he’s made leaving us with the highest death toll in Europe. Boris missed FIVE cobra meetings about COVID-19. He then put in place a suggested ‘stay at home’ while leaving pubs and clubs open? He raved about shaking hands with COVID-19 patients in one of his daily briefings and did not enforce lockdown until far too late. He DIDN’T put in place the fact that people arriving on planes would need to quarantine until May and has literally only just made it necessary to wear face coverings on public transport in June? This is literally only about 1% of his mistakes? Everything people are praising Boris on doing, the rest of Europe has been doing much better? It is honestly painful that you have so much respect for such an awful leader. Do your research. AND ONE MORE THING - saying Dominic Cummings was ‘doing what any parent would do’ when he drove his child across the country while his wife was suspected of having rona, I expect you all have this same energy when immigrants travel miles to free their children from war torn countries and awful home situations and if not seriously re-evaluate your morals.

We hope everyone is having a good pride month so far and exams are going well. For those of us who are in our final year of university, we’re coming up to a bittersweet time. Many of us should be celebrating with friends and spending way too much time in Lounge… Unfortunately this year, that is not the case. So, Bristruths is stepping in to help!

On Sunday 21st June Bristruths will be holding an online graduation for everyone graduating this year. The ceremony will take place on our Minecraft server, but will also be live streamed on the Bristruths page. Everyone graduating this year can take part (you don’t have to have Minecraft) and even if you’re not graduating there will be an opportunity to get involved!

After the ceremony, we will also have a quiz that everyone, including those not graduating, can take part in - prizes TBA. To end the day we will of course be heading to Lounge!

Waitrose: Conservatives. quite expensive and they include things like champagne flutes in their waitrose essentials range. Need I say more?

Sainsbury’s/Morrison’s LibDems. No one is really sure why these two supermarkets exists and yet there they are. Not really middle class enough to be tory but still somewhere M&S and Waitrose shoppers fear to tread - LibDems.

Better foods: Green Party. Do we really need an explanation? Everything is quite expensive but you can persuade yourself you’re healing the world by buying a small pack of nuts for £11 from a white woman with dreadlocks.

Tesco: Labour. Bit boring but usually there for you - they boast a banging meal deal and while they are out to fleece you on most of their products, they’re more affordable than other alternatives.

Scotmid: SNP. They put the word Scot in the name of a supermarket. Need I say more?

B&M home bargains: UKIP.

Lidl/Aldi: floating voter or minor parties. These guys know what’s up
and won’t be tied down to one supermarket and are savvy enough to know to shop around. Part of this is the fact they can’t tell whether they’re in Aldi or Lidl at any given time.

Co-op: Labour and Co-operative Party. Partially the name but also because although reliable and often present - no one really knows what the co-op or the Labour co-op Party are all about.

ASDA: non voters. Who needs to vote when your favourite snacks are on rollback? Everything is usually pretty cheap and the products aren’t really anything special. As a-political as you can get.

Iceland: Brexit Party. Despite being named after a European nation this is a special reserve for those who simply detest the idea of fresh food.

I am definitely supportive of the cause, but the number of angry, demaning articles, headlines and facebook posts makes me feel obligated to speak out on this topic.

As an MSc student I am no stranger to the struggles of paying 9 grand a year for what is currently a bit of a shit show of a degree, but before we go throwing accusations around I think people should consider what they are asking for. The university has already frozen all non-essential spending and is doing all the can to preserve money to keep the lights on, including a freeze on hiring which leaves them in a problematic spot for coping with staff on sick leave etc. They are looking at significant debt over the next few years that will surpass the tens of millions.
On top of that, our lecturers are still working their full contracts trying to give is any semblance of the same quality of education we deserve. Many are infact working significant unpaid overtime hours to compensate for the need to completely redesign courses, exams and design next years syllabus' and teaching styles online. So when you demand a refund for your discomfort and annoyance, please consider what you're actually asking... where do you think the money is coming from? Who will suffer and why do you feel so entitled? Please respect that the staff are still working their hardest for us so the least we can do is treat them with equivalent respect and understanding.",109,3

611,"Dear Bristol,","
For many of us, June is a special month, not just because of exams (although we’re as excited as you are) but because it is LGBT+ Pride month. It is a chance for people of all ages, gender identities, and backgrounds to celebrate inclusion and openness. Whoever we are, and whoever we love; pride allows us to celebrate the amazing achievements we have made in the fight for equality. It highlights the problems and injustices we still face, as well as the amazing work that people all over the world do to achieve a more equal society.

The last week has seen a horrifying event take place in the United States. One that has triggered protests all over the globe, protests whose sole aim is justice and equality. These values are at the core of pride and for that reason Bristruths wants to start pride month by highlighting the work of BME LGBT+ activists, and the work they are doing to bring justice and equality to communities all over the world.

We have a number of exciting things planned over the coming month. This will include discussing the origins of pride; what we now consider to be a celebration that was originally born from violent protest at a New York bar and club. These protests were the catalyst for a huge change of policy and attitude towards the LGBT+ community.

We hope this campaign helps to educate as well as celebrate our amazing community and we look forward to sharing those stories with you.

8) Vic Rooms - it would be sick if they could remove the chairs and welcome different genres, but the only gigs that aren't prohibitively expensive are student classical ensembles/ occasional jazz (even these cost more than the average Bristol gig). The whole place should really be more accommodating to music that isn't read out of books

7) Mr Wolf's - this may surprise many of you, but wolfs has earned the place of second to last because it's not big enough for its own hype. If you give up on trying to get a good view, you end up getting pissed on cheap thatchers and act more rowdy than anyone reasonably can be when watching bujo stand there awkwardly and play music that's way cooler than they'll ever be (sorry bujo). The only escape is the smoking area where you can watch posh freshers smoke malboroughs and listen to them chat philosophical bollocks at bored yet polite locals.

6) Thekla - always further away than you expect, too many middle-aged men standing at the peripheries or behind the netting on the top deck, and the novelty of being on a boat wears off quicker than you expect. However, pretty well ventilated, and smoking on a boat is nice, when it's not raining.

5) The Fleece - tribute bands play here almost every night, but in between there are some occasional great gigs. You can get a fair view from pretty much anywhere, feels purpose built for live music. Almost makes up for the fact that the floor is unbelievably sticky, and the bar staff are mean.

4) O2 Academy - difficult to get a good spot, and you'll encounter at least a few pissed locals who don't seem to know where they are or care. However, great sound system, you'll have a great time if you reach the front, and you can get a 2 pint beer which fuels a great deal of enthusiasm.

3) The Louisiana - tiny, secluded, with a big age range in the gig attendees. If you follow any small UK based artists a lot of them will stop off here on a small tour. Some gigs will flop but tickets are often cheap and the community vibe is very nice.

2) Rough Trade - another pretty small venue, hosts artists of the up-and-coming variety, like a radio 1 dj's favourite new artist or something. Less often older people here, which just means the atmosphere is a bit less up-tight and there's more dancing and flailing. Good moshing can be found here.

1) Stokes Croft (crofters rights, canteen, social, leftbank) - brilliant places to see local artists, fusion jams and alternative djs. Watch a rapper stand up, grab the mic and go into a lyrical trance while the band blasts some disco funk fire. Stand barely a foot away from these geniuses creating music in the moment, feel your body move with the rhythm, look across and wave at that outlandish character that started talking to you at the bar, who's wiggling around with a bottle of desperados in their hand.

As a fellow law student, I wish to applaud your initiative and courage for writing the email. I would not have the courage as you do hence I am utilising the platform of Bristruths to convey this message. I sincerely hope you’re feeling better and the best of health to you and your family during these difficult times.

I wish to put across an opinion, perhaps unpopular, that the email was fairly presumptuous and self-entitled. In particular, you proposed that the law school would prioritise your well-being by cancelling exams, yet you urge the school to not jeopardise your degree that you’ve spent 3 years on.

I believe by cancelling the exam, not only will it jeopardise the degree you implored the school not to, it will have rippling effect onto further years in the form of Bristol Law School’s ranking, should Bristol be the only law school to do so.

You’ve further criticised the school to stop being a follower and become a leader.

While I can only presume this, I believe as with any institution ,especially one such as the Russel Group, Bristol’s executive team are heavily bound by the decisions of the Russel Group executives and have minimum sway in the matter.

Although I whole-heartedly agree that the school can definitely step up their responses and measures in times like this, I personally think you projected a heavy bias by making the letter publicly personal.

Some of us do not want the exams to be cancelled. Some of us do. The fact that you drafted a public email that will undoubtedly gather a significant number of traction and will lead the school to assume that the latter holds true.

Online assessments are currently a fair way that the school has proposed to balance both the worth of the degree that you treasure as well as your well-being. If you truly wish for your painstaking degree not to be jeopardise, I’d suggest reconsidering your proposal to cancel exams entirely.",13,4

802,#Bristruth27896,"Inspired by #Bristruth27809 I'm taking it upon myself to also bring you some quality (+somewhat simpler) film reviews as a non-film student starting with…

Martha Marcy May Marlene (2011) - Independent Drama/Mystery

Starring: Elizabeth Olsen (Ingrid Goes West, Wind River, Sorry for Your Loss, Marvel Cinematic Universe) and Sarah Paulson (American Horror Story, Oceans 8, Glass)
Director: Sean Durkin

The plot focuses on a young woman suffering from delusions and paranoia after returning to her family from an abusive cult in the Catskill Mountains.

What a breakthrough for Elizabeth Olsen. Having already fell in love with her work listed above I was keen to explore her other films. Her performance as Martha is completely mesmerizing as she perfectly depicts a young girl scarred by the events of her past in a tasteful, subtle way. The look in her puppy-dog eyes really makes you feel for her and you pity the way she has lost all sense of normality in the film. Sarah Paulson's work in the film, although in a lesser role, is equally as endearing, with her unique voice and facial expressions blasting her emotions out as she attempts to untangle and deal with the strange repercussions of her sister's psychological trauma.

The film itself does very well to explore the topic of a cult where rules are twisted and bent into manipulations - making sure to portray a highly realistic yet haunting story as you follow each scene which is laced with uncomfortable events and the inevitable consequences which follow.

The tension is high throughout (as it should be in a thriller) which is a delicious contrast to the somewhat calm ambience the music and photography seems to convey. With a quiet yet startling ending, this film is definitely worth a watch.

Lost in Translations as a film originally was lost on me; having heard so many raving reviews, to say I was disappointed I think would be fair but I feel it’s one of those films which come to you after the viewing. The film follows two people, Charlotte and Bob, who are lost in their lives seeing change and confusion. Bob Has been married for 25 years with two children which is shown to have lost its flame while also dealing with being an actor that is no longer in many films anymore and rather working in advertising a Japanese whisky. The irony of this in casting Murray is not lost however as the title might suggest as Murray in real life could only be seen as very similar. While Charlotte has just finished studying philosophy in Yale, marrying a photographer who is out in Japan shooting at band with her unsure about her new marriage.

The film shows absence in a way I don’t think I’ve seen before with both characters showing absence from their surroundings separated from the city and people through a language barrier and often shown in their rooms when alone looking out their windows over Tokyo as if it is almost too much to take in. Often when travelling out into the city with Charlotte we are given a hugely loud and confusing environment with the arcade showing loud music and her watching over people but never joining in. When at temples, she watches over monks but never communicates or involves herself. However, when she does, like with the flower decorating, the barrier becomes unimportant because human connection becomes more important, although she can’t understand what the woman helping her is saying, the connection between her and the woman causes her feel less lost and welcome into the city for one of the first times. I love the shots from both characters when they are walking through crowds of people with the camera only focussing on them. It leaves them so isolated from everyone else, giving a real sense of their isolation in a huge city.

The isolation in a huge city I think it also one thing that makes the ending so huge. As Bob leaves, he sees Charlotte and gets out the cab to talk to her before he goes. The dramatic chase is not there as one might expect but they found eachother in the city and helped eachother feel less lonely. The chances of him finding her before he left was so small, reminding us of the luck they had in order to find eachother in the first place. The ending in itself feels anti-climatic, we expect Bob to chase after Charlotte and confess his unequivocal love to her; I was expecting an ending like Manhattan by Woody Allen. However, the whisper we never hear and him leaving afterwards feels wrong but I think it’s the perfect ending to a film all about loneliness as they share their final words in their friendship (idk if it was just a friendship tbf) with us left out, causing us to question what Bob says but truth is, it’s not for us to know as we are merely a spectator on their relationship, reminding us that, although we haven’t seen it form, we ourselves our isolated from their relationship and we’re only there to watch it.

The film focusses on the importance of experiences with everyone but the two main characters surrounded by an excess of materialistic objects. Many of the arcade games, like the one with the drums, take traditional Japanese instruments and exposes it to capitalism while Charlotte goes to see the temples and traditional Japanese life, causing it to feel that many Japanese people may have lost their own culture to that of capitalism. Bob’s wife is obsessed with carpets sending him samples with the irony that they are all different shades of burgundy that look exactly the same. One of the most important scenes is when Bob is in the bath with on call with his wife who says they are out of stock of the burgundy carpet. Bob shows no care telling her to choose the carpet with her being lost in what he means. It showed the difference between the two as Bob realised his life was unhealthy but his wife doesn’t seem to understand or listen to him, too distracted by the world around her. The exact same thing happens to Charlotte as she calls a friend trying to explain her loss of self and struggles in her marriage to a friend for them not to listen. What’s important about Bob and Charlotte’s relationship is they listen to eachother with the scene where the romantic couple would usually consummate saw them just talking with Charlotte talking about her confusion on what to do and Bob telling her to keep writing, reassuring her he’s confident that whatever she does, she will be ok. It does make me laugh that I have only got around to just watching this film now with every time someone tells me to watch it, I always say I’m too busy but maybe that’s something Coppola was aiming for.

One thing that did wrong I think was the comedy through Japan’s culture and people often leave them as the joke due to their language and often acting as caricatures such as that of the escort with his mispronunciation of rip and also of the photographer being unable to pronounce Roger Moore properly. I think if you were Japanese, it could he seen as culturally insensitive to a certain degree and the joke, ironically, could be lost in translation as it seems like they are the runt of the joke. I think this occurred due to Coppola herself also being an outsider and therefore possibly not quite getting the culture herself with sometimes feeling like the film itself is alienated from the country it’s filmed in (but I get that’s the point to some degree). As referred to earlier, I think Manhattan (Woody Allen) did a similar thing to this film but didn’t cause the city to feel so alienated and so possibly did better job for me there. I would wonder what this film would be like if it was filmed from a director from Japan or possibly even Tokyo, I’m sure much of the humour wouldn’t have been so western suited. The film I think it would have probably ended up like Fallen Angels (Wong Kar Wai).

Overall Lost in Translation is a beautiful film, it talks about some things so subtly which makes it so amazing but it is a very western and, even more so, American film in the way it deals with culture of other countries and I couldn’t myself get behind it. I found much of the comedy for me fell flat due to this. I will have to come back to this film at some point. When I’m not too busy.

Obviously the Bristruths campaign video - it tackles some of the most prominent issues we students face altogether, and more importantly, by putting it in god tier it will undoubtedly get posted (pls admins I need the validation)

Good Tier:
Despite not really knowing what she stands for, Cordelia had some pretty good bars in her vid without coming off as completely desperate. The cinematography of it all was also quite enjoyable

Okay Tier:
Ostin started off really strong with that deep male voice in the opening verse but for me it kinda fizzled throughout the chorus. Least he got his message across though

Shit Tier:
No disrespect, David's video has provided me with some good laughs, moreso than the other two. He gets all the points he's made in his manifesto but the whole 'vogue' thing seems very try-hard, resulting in it being the most cringy thing I've ever seen.

So I finally found the courage to talk to her. And this is where my world flipped upside down. Grace was more than I could have ever expected. She was warm, friendly, kind, and most importantly, completely accepting of me.

Bristruths Wellbeing Review

Bristruths
10 February at 12:00 ·

Over the next two weeks, Bristruths will be running a “Wellbeing Review” of Bristol University with supporting work from Epigram. The goal of this review is to gather positive and negative stories of wellbeing at Bristol. This could be to do with course stress, depression, loneliness, or any other aspect of uni life that affects people’s mental health. We want to hear your experiences of wellbeing, where you think the University is doing well, and where you think it could improve.

We will be running two submission points for people to share their stories. The first will be a regular submission page. Here, people should anonymously submit content. The second submission point will be a google form with an included field for a university email.

At the end of the two week period two things will happen. Firstly, Epigram will contact a selection of people from the Google form submissions that we’ll share with them. They will interview them and publish their stories, anonymously if preferred, in print or online. Secondly, all anonymous submissions will be delivered by hand to University Senior Management in both printed form and a single electronic copy. Please submit to both submission points if you wish to be a part of both actions.

We are aware that content of this nature is highly confidential. Only one Bristruth admin and one Epigram editor will have access to the submissions. Once the Epigram editor has chosen people to contact, a small selection of the team will be involved in the interviewing and writing process. Submitting on the Google form still allows you to remain anonymous in any Epigram articles. At the end of the project, all submissions will be deleted.

None of these submissions will be posted to Facebook.

On a final note, we are not doing this to try and draw a target on the University. We are looking for people to provide examples of where services have been a success, as well as constructive criticism where the University needs improvement. Importantly, we want these to be personal stories, something that can’t be told through boxes on a survey.

Thank you for being a part of this project.

892,#Bristruth27163,"As inspired by the legends that have come before me I present a review of the SU water fountains, starting with:

Link Space 1:

Flow Rate: 1.5 litres/minute, nothing to write home about but plenty of time to eye fuck the occupants of the link space. (6.5/10)
Cleanliness: Your average water fountain grime, not enough to make you find an alternative. (7/10)
Location: Nice and close to most of the attractions to be found in the SU (not sure what they are?) (8/10)
Fountain: No fountain to speak of here, water bottles only, very disappointing. (0/10)
Taste: Good quality Bristol water, bit cloudy as flow begins. Chilled water would be nice. (7.5/10)

Overall: It’s probably the flagship water fountain of the SU due to its location and so an overall rating of (5.8/10) is rather disappointing. Add to this the fact it has only recently been repaired because of the graduation ceremony and well I’ve got a rather sour after taste.

919,"Over the next two weeks, Bristruths will be running a “Wellbeing Review” of Bristol University with supporting work from Epigram. The goal of this review is to gather positive and negative stories of wellbeing at Bristol. This could be to do with course stress, depression, loneliness, or any other aspect of uni life that affects people’s mental health. We want to hear your experiences of wellbeing, where you think the University is doing well, and where you think it could improve.","
We will be running two submission points for people to share their stories. The first will be a regular submission page. Here, people should anonymously submit content. The second submission point will be a google form with an included field for a university email.

At the end of the two week period two things will happen. Firstly, Epigram will contact a selection of people from the Google form submissions that we’ll share with them. They will interview them and publish their stories, anonymously if preferred, in print or online. Secondly, all anonymous submissions will be delivered by hand to University Senior Management in both printed form and a single electronic copy. Please submit to both submission points if you wish to be a part of both actions.

We are aware that content of this nature is highly confidential. Only one Bristruth admin and one Epigram editor will have access to the submissions. Once the Epigram editor has chosen people to contact, a small selection of the team will be involved in the interviewing and writing process. Submitting on the Google form still allows you to remain anonymous in any Epigram articles. At the end of the project, all submissions will be deleted.

None of these submissions will be posted to Facebook.

On a final note, we are not doing this to try and draw a target on the University. We are looking for people to provide examples of where services have been a success, as well as constructive criticism where the University needs improvement. Importantly, we want these to be personal stories, something that can’t be told through boxes on a survey.

Thank you for being a part of this project.

956,#Bristruth26724,"It happened. It actually happened. The moment that I hoped would never come but always knew lay in my future at this University. The question now is: is this a one of occurrence or will I suffer the same pain that I felt today again? I walked in late to a lecture, this afternoon, and sat there to figure out if it was mine. It wasn't.

Panicked and fueled by caffeine, I burst through the doors in the front of the lecture theatre, only to catch a glimpse of a decisively less Chinese class than I'm used to. As I hastily slid onto the nearest seat, the eyes of hundreds of students burned into the back of my head. Did they know that I wasn't meant to be there? Was there anyone that I knew in the class? How long had the class been going on for? Question upon question flowed through my mind as it became absorbed further and further into itself. My almost trance like state was only broken as the lecturer asked ""can you please discuss some of your ideas with the people around you"". Fear shot through my body.

I know what you are thinking. ""Oh god, he didn't try to discuss the topic with the students that are actually taking the course did he""? No.

I whipped out my phone as a comforting presence, as any person in my generation does when presented with an awkward situation. This aided me twofold. Not only was my anxious mind immediately soothed somewhat, but this gave the unmistakable signal to the rest of the cohort that I was not here for a chit chat. This bought me some time to think. As I looked up from my phone, a student walked past. ""Of course"" I thought to myself. ""Sneak away while you have the chance and they will forget you were ever here"". Being the 6' 3"", 120kg person I am, I'm sure no one even noticed in the first place...

I hope this bought some much needed entertainment to the somewhat self-explanatory lecture that it seemed to be.",29,0

974,#Bristruth26559,"Degrees as types of bread

English -> white bread. Very simple, plain, standard. Versatile. Generally regarded as alright by everyone, however thinks they are more loved than they universally are. People who love it LOVE it. Won’t have any other kind of bread, won’t do any other kind of degree. In direct conflict with....

Medicine/Engineering/Maths -> brown bread. A healthier choice (for consuming and for job prospects in this modern world). Not for everyone, but again, those who champion brown bread will fight to the death to defend it. Rather boring.

History -> rye bread. Dense, serious, a grown up choice. Somehow makes sense as it appears to be a bread people ate in the dark ages.

Geography -> tiger bread. Think you are edgy and different, in reality a variation of white bread and generally regarded like English - something you do because you couldn’t make your mind up at A-Level. Slightly better job prospects as people may pick you for the novelty.

Philosophy -> pitta bread. Spend so long figuring out how to do it properly, ends up a pile of crumbs.

Languages -> panini. A staple, will always be studied, will always be eaten. Both the basis of the appeal of tiny cafés.

Liberal Arts -> pumpernickel bread. What is it? How do you find it? What does it mean? What is it made of?

Physics -> granary bread. Again, good for you but only strange people are into it.

Chemistry -> brown seeded bread. Slightly more interesting than standard brown bread. Risky. Might choke on a seed, might explode the lab.

Biology -> bagel. Good vibes. Generally beloved by everyone. Takes precise anatomical knowledge to slice in half properly, always in a pairing.

Law -> baguette. Takes a lot of effort to eat, but worth the pay off. High risk, high reward (goes off in about 0.2 seconds but also delicious). Too tough for the delicate.

Theology -> communion wafer. All about Christ. Goes well with wine, there always seems to be empty bottles on the floor in the department.

Classics -> cinnamon & raisin bagel. Some people love it, some people hate it. Posh, for people with acquired tastes.

Economics -> brioche. Exceedingly rich in flavour and financial status. Thinks it’s better than it is because it’s always a popular choice.

Not going to uni -> sourdough bread. The best option.",256,157

1) The Zombies - You see them in lecture theatres and seminars but have no idea who they are. Effectively fleshy weights used to fill rooms/lectures but seem void of any signs of sentience. They tend to look like the specific pool of people that are too good for love island, but not good enough for made in chelsea. They're in their third year but still maintain a STRONG stoke bishop energy.

2) The dodecahedrons- These guys are so edgy, they put the regular bristol cool kids to shame. Corduroy, tweed, berets, faux fur, baggy t-shirts, DMs, filas, flares- whatever the trend- it definitely started here. There's an aspirational bob dylan vibe within this group of people that, perhaps somewhat unachieved, is pretty charming, and at the very least, they've always got filters handy.

3) The smart ones: A small group of people that actually manage to finish all of the set reading and actually speak during seminars. Everyone hates them a little bit because they clearly wank to the sound of their own voice- but really we're all a little relieved when they walk though the door because it means we can all hide behind their massive egos. They can be terrible or great- most of them consider themselves modern day Simone de Beauvoirs and satres. They are perhaps something closer to Rupi Kaur.

4) The private school ones. Probably the most vapid, were it not for the Zombies. These ones can be loud and use long words like dodecahedron- they probably had a great English teacher in sixth form where they studied Ulysses, and thought they were living in a real life Dead Poet's Society. However, upon coming to university- realised that they didn't really care for english too much and have more often than not read absolutely nothing. They have an aura that suggests they kinda miss the Empire. It is sometimes hard to distinguish between this type of student and 'the smart one' as they are both good at bullshitting. A good way to determine which is which: 'the private school ones' can exclusively be found in Bargs every other night.

5) The other 30%: These guys are just pretty normal, sweet, smart people. The kind you'd be relieved to have in a group presentation. Diligently read the books and do well without boasting. You'll find yourself thinking: I wonder why we're not really good friends? Then you remember, they're mind-numbingly boring.

6) And last, but certainly not least: The poets: These tortured artists can often be found scribbling down lines of poetry, with knitted brows as they wonder which one would be best to send to Helicon. You might see them sitting across from you in life-drawing, or getting arrested at that XR protest. Yeah they're a little bit cliched- but they're pretty fit so you go along with their whims anyway. All this aside you could probably see them voting tory in 20 years time.",47,21

It doesn't matter who you are, what you identify as or how old you are etc, we're all human with complex minds and while it is often tempting to run away from thoughts which seem like they shouldn't be there, it is always best to talk about them, rather than locking them away where they can fester and come back to haunt you even more. These may be thoughts that have been around for years or maybe have just surfaced but honestly, it is worth talking to friends, family, tutors, doctors or anyone. There is always something in what we so badly want to talk about that others can relate to and I know from experience that it is scary to let these thoughts out and feel the emotions that come with them. But in the long term it is better to experience uncomfortable emotions in talking out your thoughts for a short time compared to fencing them in and ignoring them and hoping they'll go away only to have them haunt you more frequently. Liberate your minds and make your life easier, we're all human. It's good to talk and it's OK not to be OK.",29,0

Tired of having no one to keep you warm and cosy at night??

Tired of having boring, unromantic dates??

Tired of having to deal with fuckboys all the time??

Searching for that perfect early Christmas present this year??

Then look no further than this bristruth here! I shall give you a once in a lifetime opportunity to play the notorious game - ‘24 hours with a virgin’!!!

First, allow me to introduce myself! My full name is ****************** but I go under the alias ‘The Gurning Virgin’ (‘cause apparently I gurn even when I’m just drinking). I’m a hard working guy, passionate about my degree. I have dark hair and brown eyes and - being as modest as possible - I would describe myself as average/good looking. I don’t like to big myself up too much, but take a look at the amazing compliments I have recently received from females:

“Wow you are so creepy!” - Gravity, 13/11/19

“I seriously wish you luck in losing your virginity!” - Motion, 15/11/19

“Honestly, in the nicest possible way, fuck off!” - Lizard Lounge, 22/11/19

“You can’t get laid can you!” - Pryzm, 27/11/19

Hopefully all of this will be enough to tempt you to sign up to playing the most coveted game of all: ‘24 hours with a virgin’! Let me now describe to you how it will all work - simply give this post a ❤️ react and I will message you to arrange a day which would work for both of us; the rules of the game are as follows:

1. We shall meet at 11am outside of Parsons! We will grab a coffee and have a friendly chat to get to know each other whilst walking to clifton triangle!

2. We will then arrive at Pinkmans where we will have a lovely brunch to fuel us for the day!

3. Next, we will head off down to Bristol Aquarium - perfect for you sea life lovers!

4. After that we will take a short walk over to the M-Shed museum - fantastic for us to discover Bristol’s history!

5. We will then pop over to St Nicholas’ market to pick up a quick drink and some cake!

6. It will then be time to come back to mine, have a quick shower and change to get ready for evening!

7. We shall then head off to clifton village to have a romantic evening three course meal at the Ivy Brasserie - you can’t get more romantic than that!

8. Once we’ve eaten, it’ll then be time to get absolutely hammered at the Cori Tap - bet you can’t do the Cori Tap Challenge! 😉

9. Now that we’ll be absolutely shitfaced it will be time to go back to yours - we will take some time to chill out!

10. And now for the final, optional part of the game - complete this and you will have outright won ‘24 hours with a virgin’! If you choose, we will have the most steamy, sensual and spicy sexual encounter you could ever have hoped for! Of course you can reject the offer - but why would you when you have the chance to rid ‘The Gurning Virgin’ of his virginity and receive the greatest accolade of them all - the winner of ‘24 hours with a virgin’! We will have passionate, fiery and sweaty sex! We will make absolute magic happen in the bedroom!

Of course we will eventually fall asleep, wake up in the morning and then give each other the biggest hug possible to express our thankfulness for giving each other the greatest day of our lives! I will congratulate you on winning the game and, depending on how well we got on, I may then get on my knees and propose to you! I mean it wouldn’t get much better would it - “I met my husband through playing ‘24 hours with a virgin’”!

So ladies - are you up for the challenge?? Do you back yourselves to win?? Do you dare to achieve eternal greatness?? This is your chance to go down in the history books! This is your chance to claim glory! Give this post a ❤️ and you’ll be within touching distance from being a true champion - the winner of ‘24 hours with a virgin’!

See you soon!!! X

Title: Can Mathematical Modelling Really Help You Lose Your Virginity?

1. Abstract:

Losing your virginity can be an excruciatingly difficult challenge for many unattractive, or short, or stinky, or socially awkward guys. I empathise greatly. For this reason I have been motivated to find rigorous models which can aid one in attaining the holy grail of humanity - having sex.

It had recently come to my attention that losing your virginity can essentially be viewed mathematically as a dynamical system. One can use a system of ordinary differential equations to model the methods in which to convince a girl to have sex with you for the very first time.

An example of a such a model could, for argument’s sake, involve the following: take time, “t”, as an independent variable; we could then use equations involving variables “c” and “h” dependent on time, representing “compliments given to the girl” and “humourous remarks made in conversation” respectively, to give a suitable model.

One can then analyse the solutions to such appropriate model (note we are working with autonomous systems only in this project). We aim for a system which provides asymptotically stable solutions.

In layman’s terms this means the following - when one initially approaches a girl and starts a conversation with her, we are obviously starting a bit further away from the required solution (which is of course having a hot, steamy night of sexual passion in the bedroom). We want to find a system of differential equations such that if we start in a position a bit further away from our goal, as time goes on we move closer and closer and closer to our dream target!

Now of course we have to be consistent with the theory of ordinary differential equations - we can never officially touch the target solutions given an arbitrary starting point. If we were to do that then that would suggest we’d end up shagging the target girl for an infinite amount of time. Now unless you’re an absolute total tank and beast in bed, shagging for an infinite amount of time is impossible. But once we get so close in our model - we’ve essential bagged that absolute stunner we’ve been looking for!

On the other hand, Lyapunov stable solutions are undesirable: you know the times when you’re talking to girl and it’s going ok but that sexual spark just isn’t kicking off - that’s what this correlates to. And of course unstable solutions are not on the cards - no one wants flat out rejections as soon as you say hi!

2. Finding The Perfect Model

I can confirm that finally I have found a perfect system which satisfies the required conditions necessary to get any girl to have sex with you. In other words my virginity will be approaching its death very soon!!!

Now I cannot share this system equations and its variables with you - I would not like you to enjoy the sexual success and prowess that I am on the verge of embarking on. But what I can share with you is a couple of initial conversational tips (initial conditions) that would certainly work for my dynamical system and would get you laid without a doubt! But finding the correct dynamical system is up to you!

Initial condition 1) approach a girl and say “hey sexy, you are absolutely different gravy my darling, let’s have a taste of each other!” Initial condition 2) approach a girl and say “hey gorgeous, I want hardcore sex with you so bad babe, get in bed with me!”

Given that you can devise the right model, I’ve found that these conversation starters are guaranteed to get you that good old shag and rid you of that dreaded virginity that has plagued your life for so many years!

3. Conclusion

Mathematics has come to the rescue once again: it will help me - and you - lose that virginity! I am so looking forward to implementing my new found methods from this week onwards - the results will be amazing!

[note: wow I’m such a virgin, if I don’t get slapped in the face after trying this I’ll consider it a success ngl, but this is what the maths has told me to do. Need to have faith in maths you know, hopefully works. See you soon beautiful ladies X]",100,92

1121,#Bristruth25059,"A guide to some of the criticisms against Jeremy Corbyn

- ‘He’s a terrorist sympathiser!’- not just untrue but pretty much the opposite of true. He won the Gandhi award for promoting peace in Northern Ireland and elsewhere and was one of the MPs to sign a letter actively condemning the bombings in Birmingham. The entirety of criticism in this regard comes from pictures of him with the Sinn Fein politicians Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, both of whom have also been pictured with the Queen and Prince Charles because they’re politicians not terrorists.
- ‘He doesn’t care about defence, he won’t use the nuclear option!’- also just straight untrue. He has committed to using nuclear weapons as a retaliatory method if necessary, but prefers systems of de escalation than a pre-emptive strike. I can not comprehend how preferring diplomacy to murdering millions of civilians is a controversial policy.
- ‘He doesn’t tell us how he’s going to pay for anything, he just wants a magic money tree!’- the Labour manifesto from 2017 is costed and it is effectively the same as 2019’s (which is yet to be announced), so you can have a look at how Labour intends to pay for its policies if you can actually be bothered. Do you know who’s manifesto isn’t costed? The Conservatives.
- ‘Labour is anti-Semitic!’- this is the best of a bad bunch of criticisms. The home affairs select committee concluded that ‘no reliable evidence to support the notion that antisemitism is any more prevalent in the Labour Party than in any other political party’. 0.08% of the members were found to have expressed anti Semitic sentiments and were expelled in 2018. Contrary to some opinion, Labour has also accepted without qualification the IHRA definition and put in place a more expedient method for removing members who are accused of anti semitism. I’m not saying that Jewish people who have expressed concern are lying or wrong, and I personally do think Labour need to take stronger and more public measures but I do think people in the media with vested interests in compromising Labour have distorted the facts to try and sway public opinion.
- According to an LSE study only 11% of newspaper articles accurately represent Jeremy Corbyn’s views without qualification, the highest being the Guardian who manage to do it 27% of the time.

If you aren’t voting Labour for any of these reasons please reconsider and maybe ask yourself why the wealthy owners of so many news organisations feel threatened enough to lie about these things....

Austerity has killed 130,000 people since 2012, the Conservatives and Lib Dem’s voted for it. Do the right thing.

The biscuit in question was an Oreo. A suitable vegan treat one might believe. WRONG AGAIN. A simple google leads me to Oreo's website which clearly states that the biscuits are NOT suitable for vegans because they have milk as a cross contact.

So what did I do? I went right to the top and sent a message to the vice president of vegan society (who has frequently visited Taka Taka and Donervans on a night out and also ate my breadsticks which may contain milk as well btw) But what was her response?

1243,#Bristruth23582,"Here is my personal ranking of the three versions of 'No Ordinary Girl' from H2O: Just Add Water:

3) Indiana Evans (Season 3)
Now I know I'm going to get a lot of hate for this one considering Indiana Evans plays Bella Hartley on the show and everyone seems to like her for some reason. I'll admit, the song is definitely the best produced and mastered version but overall I just find it extremely basic and 'neutral' sounding. Positives include the big lead into the chorus and the nice use of ad-libs whilst the negatives include a lack of 'power' in Indiana's voice and the worst bridge of the three (its way too short). 5/10

2) Ellie Henderson (Season 1)
A lot of people may feel as though this one is the best because it was the original, I'm not going to base my opinion on this fact alone. Ellie has the best voice of the three and the song carries a quick tempo, allowing it to sound much more exciting than Indiana's. Also I really like the 'gi-i-i-i-r-l-l-l' part (if you know you know). However, the song suffers from a really long guitar rift which doesn't really fit and there is a very limited use of instruments and production. 7/10

1) Kate Alexa (Season 2)
This is it. This is the only version of these songs I can get up and dance to. It has the best bridge, the biggest lead into the chorus and has a really edgy rock vibe. Whilst Kate does appear to have the worst voice of the three, it isn't really needed to carry the rest of the song. 9/10 (imagine if Ellie sung on this version wooow)",39,30

1253,#Bristruth23502,"[Overseas Student from Hong Kong]
As many of you might be aware of, there was a huge protest in Hong Kong. More than 1 million people went out and protested against the Extradition Law Amendment Bill (ELAB), about 1/7th of the population in Hong Kong.
The reason why many people were against it was because, with the Bill passes, the Chinese government could extradite any fugitives that committed felony in China. When Hong Kong was under the British Regime the established Common Law system was intended to have a barrier between the us and the Chinese legal system as China has been known for not having “fair” legal system. Many people in China were arrested based on their political point of view, and yet were charged with another irrelevant crime (eg. Ai Weiwei - tax evasion)

Officials in Hong Kong are now pushing the ELAB to pass this Wednesday. With that enacted, Chinese government would be able to lawfully prosecute anyone who speak against the authority. All they need is just creativity and think of a crime to “legally” extradite that person. It deeply erodes the freedom of speech and protest in my opinion. People can no longer speak up for anything they feel unjust about the society. Nor will they be able to have a government that represents the people.

What I am furious the most is that those officials are all overseas passport holders, or permanent residence (especially England). It means that after treading the basic rights of people in Hong Kong, and when they retired, they could enjoy a luxurious retirement life in England or elsewhere in the world, without bearing any consequences.

I am not intended to bring up any debates in this post. All I would like to do is to share my point of view as a HongKonger, and remind the fellow members in Bristruth that Democracy is only precious when it is lost or eroded by power and authority. I was reading 1984 when I did GCSE. I considered that as a political fiction describing a dystopia state and I swear to God I have never thought of that to becoming real. Now when I read the fiction again, and looking at Hong Kong, I can’t really tell the difference between them.

I don't know why it is that these things bother me — it just makes me picture a seven year old first discovering things about an animal and, having no context about the subject, ranting about how stupid they are. I get it's a joke, but people take it as an actual, educational joke like it's a man yelling at the sea, and that's just wrong. Furthermore, these things have an actual impact on discussions about conservation efforts — If every time Koalas get brought up, someone posts this shit, that means it's seriously shaping public opinion about the animal and their supposed lack of importance.

""Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves, the only thing they eat, have almost no nutritional value.""

Non-ecologists always talk this way, and the problem is you’re looking at this backwards.

An entire continent is covered with Eucalyptus trees. They suck the moisture out of the entire surrounding area and use allelopathy to ensure that most of what’s beneath them is just bare red dust. No animal is making use of them—they have virtually no herbivore predator. A niche is empty. Then inevitably, natural selection fills that niche by creating an animal which can eat Eucalyptus leaves. Of course, it takes great sacrifice for it to be able to do so—it certainly can’t expend much energy on costly things. Isn’t it a good thing that a niche is being filled?

""They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal""

It's pretty typical of herbivores, and is higher than many, many species. According to Ashwell (2008), their encephalisation quotient is 0.5288 +/- 0.051. Higher than comparable marsupials like the wombat (~0.52), some possums (~0.468), cuscus (~0.462) and even some wallabies are <0.5. According to wiki, rabbits are also around 0.4, and they're placental mammals.

""Additionally their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons.""

Again, this is not unique to koalas. Brain folds (gyri) are not present in rodents, which we consider to be incredibly intelligent for their size.

""if you present a koala with leaves plucked from a fucking branch laid on a flat fucking surface the koala will not recognise it as food.""

If you present a human with a random piece of meat, they will not recognise it as food (hopefully). Fresh leaves might be important for koala digestion, especially since their gut flora is clearly important for the digestion of Eucalyptus. It might make sense not to screw with that gut flora by eating decaying leaves.

""Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal.""

That's an extremely weird reason to dislike an animal. But whilst we're talking about their digestion, let's discuss their poop. It's delightful. It smells like a Eucalyptus drop!",21,2

That I even had cause in the first place to have to explain to you why this behaviour makes a person uncomfortable is quite frankly ridiculous. That I am having to explain for a second time because you clearly didn't get the message is inconvenient, frustrating and should be unnecessary, but evidently isn't.

Consent is not difficult to understand, but let's break it down for your small mind so that hopefully the next woman doesn't have to:
- the basics first (as you don't even seem to have a grasp of these):
* saying nothing is not consent - a yes is required
for consent
* a person can consent and then change their mind
- Consenting once, to one kiss, is not consent to future kisses or other physical and sexual acts (see #3), nor does it permit you to continually ask for sex after the person refused the first time (see #4). Trying to change someone's mind after they have said no means that the required culture of consent is non-existent.
- Buying a person something such as a drink (or giving a favour/providing a service) does not mean that that person owes you a sexual act in return (see #1) - you cannot exchange a drink for control over another person's body.
- Being attracted to someone, again, does not give you the right to their body or the right to contact them (see #2 & #5). I am not yours, I am not an object for you to possess. Saying that you can't ""help yourself"" because you are attracted to me is not a compliment, it is a nod to rape.

Surely this is just fucking logic.

2. Enjoy your time here. Go out and socialise, do something new- you’re only young once. There’s never gonna be another time in your life when you don’t have more responsibilities, so enjoy being free.

I am now done. Most of the people on my course I will never see again and that sucks.

2182,#Bristruth3303,"Types of French guys at Bristol:

Parisian “École Privée” Antoine:

From the richest part of Paris. Came to England for his year abroad. Thinks that popularity is very important, and will always be careful about his image. Is the kind of person to unfollow people on Instagram so that his following/followers ratio looks impressive. Goes clubbing often, and nobody knows what he studies (probably not even him). Probably doesn’t speak much English, but still thinks he’s bilingual. Doesn’t have any British friends, as he has managed to recreate a “16ème arrondissement” microclimate in his residence hall. Smokes, but only in front of other people. Complains about the cigarette prices in the UK, despite it being his parents’ money (and is getting very worried about the rising prices back home).

“Weeaboo Suprême” Gaspard:

A vitriolic shut-in. Is clear proof of the strong influence of Japanese culture in France. Despises any form of human interaction, and for that reason will lock himself in his room and watch anime. Likely is an avid collector of anime stash, because “anime girls can understand him better than actual people”. Definitely watches hentai. Left France to avoid his parents’ judging stares. Despite that, a good student despite never going to lectures, and studies maths or engineering. People are usually reminded of his existence twice a year, during exams.

Literature and beaux-arts Maximilien:

The very definition of condescendant. Studies art. Has mastered all aspects of French literature, and will not let an opportunity to criticise English literature to waste. Probably has a shrine to Balzac in his room, and his understanding of the world is based on works such as L‘Assommoir, le Père Goriot, or Le Rouge et le Noir. Has mastered the piano, and refuses to play anything that’s not French, and from the classical period. Is a devout catholic. Came to the UK for a year abroad, and wants to go back home as soon as possible.

”Nobilité” Jean-François:

Born into a family of nobility, probably has the particule “de” in front of his family name. Is at uni for the “social experience”. Is as condescendant as Maxime. Is horrified by English food. Only drinks French wine bottled before 1980. Hobbies include hunting, and going to operas. Likes the idea of Theatrum Mundi. Has a decent enough level of English to be able to order food at taka taka. He secretly wishes for the return of absolute monarchy in France. Cries when anyone mentions the German Occupation, though bringing him Pierre Hermé macarons will quickly cheer him up.

“Heureusement que j’ai pas fait prépa” Michel

The most common type of frenchy you could find. Has an interest in a popular subject, such as law, medicine or engineering, but doesn’t want to study in France because of the very strong competitive spirit. Actually appreciates the UK and their university system, and loves laughing at his friends back in France that now probably have depression because of their studies. Is not from Paris, and hates having his hometown called “province” by a Parisian. Is slightly fed up of the baguette and croissant jokes.",52,89
