#Bristruth30520,right literally noone asked but as a scientist i simply had to i present my findings from a recent study which i spent far too much time and money on  a systematic review comparing a spectrum of oat milks available in uk supermarkets covering price on a scale of  texture and flavour  most milks bought where possible were unsweetened oat milks  from the most expensive to least  oatly 910  the og the real reason why i love oat milk creamy froths up beautifully and not too sweet  minor figures 910  slightly too thin but tastes amazing in coffee doesnt froth up great but would be my go to option if i was boujee  asda own brand 810  surprisingly good creamy so is a great texture only thing holding it back from reaching its true potential is the fact that it tastes like liquid sugar needs to chill out on the sweetness but grest for the price point  alpro 710  made mediocre masala chai so i have some pent up sadness associated with this which has admittedly clouded my judgement ignoring this trauma it was actually alright again it was just too sweet but on the plus side it is basically always on offer in the supermarket  homemade 610  this was a real curve ball but needed inorder to achieve a real and balanced scientific review super super cheap oats water agave  a few cashews for some fats grest texture but naturally didnt last as long and lacked a bit in my tea  lidl own brand 610  really not bad at all super affordable slightly too thin but honestly at the price that it is and the fact that ive had worse this does the job okay also provides an excuse to go to the lidl bakery so   aldi own brand with additives 410  tyra banks we were rooting for you honestly i wished i really wish this was better i am just deeply upset that its not better thin and far far too sweet  aldi own brand just oat and water 110  dont mean to be a hater because i stan the aldi soy milk but it was so thin i was like i was adding water to my tea rather than milk  plenish 5010  the worst thing ive ever put my self through needing to drink costs about one kidney per carton and is generally just the worst it is like water and tastes bitter i would literally sue if i could be bothered and i wrote this so i am clearly committee avoid at all costs ,148,76

#Bristruth30306,disclaimer the following opinion covers uk fees only  your student debt has never been and will never be crippling in any way the way you pay for university is much more akin to a graduate tax than a loan with any regular loan you have regular fixed interest payments as well as the capital repayment that will have to be returned at some point your monthlyyearly repayments have to be made irrespective of how much you earn this is fundamentally different to they way student loan repayments work  with your student loan you pay off a very affordable percentage of your salary that progressively increases as your earnings do in the same way as virtually all other taxes for most people this is 9 of your earnings over 21k this means that you should never not be able to afford the payments if you are made redundant and have no income for several years  you will pay 0 on student loan repayments your student loan will not have any impact on your credit rating and will not affect your ability to borrow money in the future in this way it is just another tax on earnings it does not behave like a loan the write off of the loan after 30 years is just you no longer having to pay this tax  dont get me wrong  the system is flawed but i believe it is flawed far more in the way it is presented as a loan and a debt than in the amount you actually have to repay  whether we should have to pay for education at all is another argument entirely people with expendable cash during the 30 years repayment period eg from inheritance can and often do pay off a lump sum of their student loan unless they are very high earners this is usually money down the drain and is only done due to the impression of being under huge amounts of debt  tldr its a tax not a debt and most certainly not crippling,124,7

#Bristruth30234,bristruth30157 response to uni should always be free ill preface this by saying a i think it is awful we are paying full price this year and b i am not saying 9k is necessarily a price however  unis get the majority of their funding from student fees so if the experience was free they would have to find this money elsewhere im guessing youre suggesting it comes from the government please correct me if youre not so taxes would have to increase or money diverted from elsewhere meaning rather than the education just being paid for by those who go to uni it will also be funded by those who choose not to go and will be at the expense of another sector  uni graduates tend to get paid better so it does seem reasonable it comes out of our pockets rather than from the taxpayer  also small point at what point does free education extend to post grad as well can i do multiple degrees for free  happy for someone to convince me otherwise how it is feasible education being free for all does sound kinda lit doe,39,15

#Bristruth30163,okay so seeing all these why are people complaining over online teaching posts let me explain 1 some of us traveled from half the world for university and yes we are paying more than uk students and yes we were aware of that but through the last months uni talked about blended learning its not blended if you dont have any face to face teaching thats called online only and im not willing to pay for an online only course 2 as said before we traveled from different countries we had to pay for visa flights transportation in general we are tied to rental contracts now this is not cheap and it is unnecessary because our modules are online and those once every other week labs arent cutting it i wont be missing out on anything if i dont attend those 3 lab sessions 3 we are far away from home tied to contracts living in a foreign country some of us are away from home for the very first time and its not easy for some of us to make friends like that its a different culture we might not feel confident enough to talk yet where is the support for students very few societies are operating normally barely any face to face teaching hardly any access to uni facilities ever thought about how this affects students wellbeing and dont tell me call night line or wellbeing services at uni this is not going to help when anxiety levels are so high 4 this is not getting our moneys worth at all we were lead on to think we will have face to face teaching which isnt happening they promised to open uni facilities and now reduced library sessions to 4 hours a week we are paying for those facilities 5 dont tell me its for the safety of others expanding gym sessions and access where people sweat together using the same equipment walking around but closing uni facilities like libraries where people sit down to study is not logical and no its not for our safety am i the only one who sees this i could go on with this list but i assume this is enough to begin with this my friends is called taking advantage of students look at glasgow or manchester how is this government going to excuse the mistreatment of students,236,7

#Bristruth29516,a note about my own privilege  first things first i do not now nor have ever considered myself bigoted in anyway if youd asked me what i thought about equality when i was 4 or 14 or 24 id have given you similar answers although hopefully advancing a little over that time the events im about to list the things ive said and done i did not consider prejudiced at the time it is only through personal growth and education that i can look back now and see how they were wrong almost everyone has been guilty of this at one point or another those saying they havent are either one in a million lying to themselves because they cant face the truth or just plainly still bigotted  i feel that at the moment with everything that is happening it is more important than ever to recognise our own often subconcious prejudices and privileges so here goes here are some of the ones i have been guilty of some of which ive only now recently considered  thats so gay was for quite some time the go to insult to use in my experience of primary and early secondary school i used the word gay as an insult on many occasions to me it never meant homosexual i thought the meaning had changed over time i was wrong this is a privilege i hold through being straight ive never had to worry about telling my friends and family who i really was ive never had to hide who i was in love with ive never had to hide part of myself im sorry  ive used sexist insults ive used certain insults more about women than about men this is a privilege i hold through being a man ive never had to worry about walking through a deserted place late at night ive never had to think hard about how what i wore would be judged by other people ive never had to be scared that my voice and ideas would go unheard in a group simply because of what was between my legs im sorry  ive been guilty of not considering my privilege when it comes to race ive been at a work christmas do on premises when it was closed to the public a black man came up and stood outside i went outside to tell him we were closed he said i know and so i asked what he was doing there i would have done the exact same to anyone regardless of race but i was guilty of not understanding how what i said may come across this is a privilege i hold through being white ive never been asked what i was doing simply because i was standing around ive never been interrogated by the police for doing absolutely nothing ive never had to fear for my life simply because of the colour of my skin im sorry  ive been guilty of being rude to taxi drivers ive been in rushes and gotten annoyed when the destination has been misunderstood this is a privilige i hold through living in a country thats language is my first ive never been shouted at to leave the country simply for the language i was talking in ive never been attacked for speaking to a friend ive never been looked down upon for not being born in the country i am in im sorry  ive dismissed older peoples views simply because they were older this is a privilege i hold through being young ive never had to worry about being mocked or patronised or ignored simply because of my age im sorry  ive used ableist language when i was growing up thats so gay was probably on par with thats so retarded as the go to insult this is a privilige i hold through not being physically or mentally disabled ive never had to worry about accessing a building that others could freely access ive never had to worry about not being taken seriously due to a speech impediment or hearing issue ive never had to go through being asked to explain a traumatic story of how i became disabled to someone i barely know im sorry  ive participated in jokes about all of the above and more ive told them and laughed at them with friends yes they were jokes yes my friends and i all knew none of us really prescribed to those viewpoints yes i thought that meant it was ok i was wrong this is a privilige i hold through being a young straight white ablebodied male atheist i have never been discriminated against based on anything i have no idea what its like or what billions of people go through in this world on a daily basis and im so sorry for my ignorance i consider myself an ally above all else i have for some time now i have made mistakes yes i was much younger but this is no excuse  all we can do is fight to be better to recognise our priviliges our prejudices and our mistakes and then fight to create a society where they no longer exist most people in the west hold some form of privilege be it from being white male straight notdisabled young christian or atheist many people hold multiple privileges as they are members of more than one of these groups we must recognise these we must see when they are being taken advantage of both by ourselves and others from the past present and future only then can we begin to drive them away and truly make the world a fairer more loving and more beautiful society,164,1

#Bristruth29489,bristruth29416 the university sending an email to show their support for blm is better than them staying silent wed say they were exercising their privilege by not making a stance for the movement in fact you saying that its hypocritical that theyre showing support because the university was built off the slave trade can be applied to a lot of people that show their support today i dont think those people or the university today want to be the benefactors of the slave trade unfortunately they just are and theyre moving in the right direction to do something about it  and yes they probably can and should do more but thats a different argument im just defending people who are at least acting positively for the movement they shouldnt be attacked they should be encouraged a negative attitude wont get people on side as much as a positive attitude will,34,0
#Bristruth29487,in absolute shock at some of the ignorant posts ive seen about sympathy for boris to feel sympathy for this man is honestly just evidence that youve completely neglected the news and choose to be blind to every fatal mistake that hes made leaving us with the highest death toll in europe boris missed five cobra meetings about covid19 he then put in place a suggested stay at home while leaving pubs and clubs open he raved about shaking hands with covid19 patients in one of his daily briefings and did not enforce lockdown until far too late he didnt put in place the fact that people arriving on planes would need to quarantine until may and has literally only just made it necessary to wear face coverings on public transport in june this is literally only about 1 of his mistakes everything people are praising boris on doing the rest of europe has been doing much better it is honestly painful that you have so much respect for such an awful leader do your research and one more thing  saying dominic cummings was doing what any parent would do when he drove his child across the country while his wife was suspected of having rona i expect you all have this same energy when immigrants travel miles to free their children from war torn countries and awful home situations and if not seriously reevaluate your morals  just because your parents tell you boris is a good leader take some initiative and do your own research and read the news its literally clear as day he is dominic cummings puppet master and just a terrible leader,291,4

#Bristruth29338,is a refund reasonable  i am definitely supportive of the cause but the number of angry demaning articles headlines and facebook posts makes me feel obligated to speak out on this topic  as an msc student i am no stranger to the struggles of paying 9 grand a year for what is currently a bit of a shit show of a degree but before we go throwing accusations around i think people should consider what they are asking for the university has already frozen all nonessential spending and is doing all the can to preserve money to keep the lights on including a freeze on hiring which leaves them in a problematic spot for coping with staff on sick leave etc they are looking at significant debt over the next few years that will surpass the tens of millions on top of that our lecturers are still working their full contracts trying to give is any semblance of the same quality of education we deserve many are infact working significant unpaid overtime hours to compensate for the need to completely redesign courses exams and design next years syllabus and teaching styles online so when you demand a refund for your discomfort and annoyance please consider what youre actually asking where do you think the money is coming from who will suffer and why do you feel so entitled please respect that the staff are still working their hardest for us so the least we can do is treat them with equivalent respect and understanding,109,3

"Dear Bristol,", for many of us june is a special month not just because of exams although were as excited as you are but because it is lgbt pride month it is a chance for people of all ages gender identities and backgrounds to celebrate inclusion and openness whoever we are and whoever we love pride allows us to celebrate the amazing achievements we have made in the fight for equality it highlights the problems and injustices we still face as well as the amazing work that people all over the world do to achieve a more equal society  the last week has seen a horrifying event take place in the united states one that has triggered protests all over the globe protests whose sole aim is justice and equality these values are at the core of pride and for that reason bristruths wants to start pride month by highlighting the work of bme lgbt activists and the work they are doing to bring justice and equality to communities all over the world  we have a number of exciting things planned over the coming month this will include discussing the origins of pride what we now consider to be a celebration that was originally born from violent protest at a new york bar and club these protests were the catalyst for a huge change of policy and attitude towards the lgbt community  we hope this campaign helps to educate as well as celebrate our amazing community and we look forward to sharing those stories with you  the admins xxx,307,1

#Bristruth28008, the email circulating by a concerned law student  as a fellow law student i wish to applaud your initiative and courage for writing the email i would not have the courage as you do hence i am utilising the platform of bristruths to convey this message i sincerely hope youre feeling better and the best of health to you and your family during these difficult times  i wish to put across an opinion perhaps unpopular that the email was fairly presumptuous and selfentitled in particular you proposed that the law school would prioritise your wellbeing by cancelling exams yet you urge the school to not jeopardise your degree that youve spent 3 years on  i believe by cancelling the exam not only will it jeopardise the degree you implored the school not to it will have rippling effect onto further years in the form of bristol law schools ranking should bristol be the only law school to do so  youve further criticised the school to stop being a follower and become a leader  while i can only presume this i believe as with any institution especially one such as the russel group bristols executive team are heavily bound by the decisions of the russel group executives and have minimum sway in the matter  although i wholeheartedly agree that the school can definitely step up their responses and measures in times like this i personally think you projected a heavy bias by making the letter publicly personal  some of us do not want the exams to be cancelled some of us do the fact that you drafted a public email that will undoubtedly gather a significant number of traction and will lead the school to assume that the latter holds true  online assessments are currently a fair way that the school has proposed to balance both the worth of the degree that you treasure as well as your wellbeing if you truly wish for your painstaking degree not to be jeopardise id suggest reconsidering your proposal to cancel exams entirely,13,4

#Bristruth27896,inspired by bristruth27809 im taking it upon myself to also bring you some quality somewhat simpler film reviews as a nonfilm student starting with  martha marcy may marlene 2011  independent dramamystery  starring elizabeth olsen ingrid goes west wind river sorry for your loss marvel cinematic universe and sarah paulson american horror story oceans 8 glass director sean durkin  the plot focuses on a young woman suffering from delusions and paranoia after returning to her family from an abusive cult in the catskill mountains  what a breakthrough for elizabeth olsen having already fell in love with her work listed above i was keen to explore her other films her performance as martha is completely mesmerizing as she perfectly depicts a young girl scarred by the events of her past in a tasteful subtle way the look in her puppydog eyes really makes you feel for her and you pity the way she has lost all sense of normality in the film sarah paulsons work in the film although in a lesser role is equally as endearing with her unique voice and facial expressions blasting her emotions out as she attempts to untangle and deal with the strange repercussions of her sisters psychological trauma  the film itself does very well to explore the topic of a cult where rules are twisted and bent into manipulations  making sure to portray a highly realistic yet haunting story as you follow each scene which is laced with uncomfortable events and the inevitable consequences which follow  the tension is high throughout as it should be in a thriller which is a delicious contrast to the somewhat calm ambience the music and photography seems to convey with a quiet yet startling ending this film is definitely worth a watch  happy watching kids this has been easybreezymoviereviews no 1,2,0

#Bristruth27809,since im stuck in my room for the next month in quarantine ive decided to put my film degree to use and so im going to review a film a day for you guys to help you decide what you watch as the world collapses the first film ive chosen is lost in translation  lost in translations as a film originally was lost on me having heard so many raving reviews to say i was disappointed i think would be fair but i feel its one of those films which come to you after the viewing the film follows two people charlotte and bob who are lost in their lives seeing change and confusion bob has been married for 25 years with two children which is shown to have lost its flame while also dealing with being an actor that is no longer in many films anymore and rather working in advertising a japanese whisky the irony of this in casting murray is not lost however as the title might suggest as murray in real life could only be seen as very similar while charlotte has just finished studying philosophy in yale marrying a photographer who is out in japan shooting at band with her unsure about her new marriage  the film shows absence in a way i dont think ive seen before with both characters showing absence from their surroundings separated from the city and people through a language barrier and often shown in their rooms when alone looking out their windows over tokyo as if it is almost too much to take in often when travelling out into the city with charlotte we are given a hugely loud and confusing environment with the arcade showing loud music and her watching over people but never joining in when at temples she watches over monks but never communicates or involves herself however when she does like with the flower decorating the barrier becomes unimportant because human connection becomes more important although she cant understand what the woman helping her is saying the connection between her and the woman causes her feel less lost and welcome into the city for one of the first times i love the shots from both characters when they are walking through crowds of people with the camera only focussing on them it leaves them so isolated from everyone else giving a real sense of their isolation in a huge city  the isolation in a huge city i think it also one thing that makes the ending so huge as bob leaves he sees charlotte and gets out the cab to talk to her before he goes the dramatic chase is not there as one might expect but they found eachother in the city and helped eachother feel less lonely the chances of him finding her before he left was so small reminding us of the luck they had in order to find eachother in the first place the ending in itself feels anticlimatic we expect bob to chase after charlotte and confess his unequivocal love to her i was expecting an ending like manhattan by woody allen however the whisper we never hear and him leaving afterwards feels wrong but i think its the perfect ending to a film all about loneliness as they share their final words in their friendship idk if it was just a friendship tbf with us left out causing us to question what bob says but truth is its not for us to know as we are merely a spectator on their relationship reminding us that although we havent seen it form we ourselves our isolated from their relationship and were only there to watch it  the film focusses on the importance of experiences with everyone but the two main characters surrounded by an excess of materialistic objects many of the arcade games like the one with the drums take traditional japanese instruments and exposes it to capitalism while charlotte goes to see the temples and traditional japanese life causing it to feel that many japanese people may have lost their own culture to that of capitalism bobs wife is obsessed with carpets sending him samples with the irony that they are all different shades of burgundy that look exactly the same one of the most important scenes is when bob is in the bath with on call with his wife who says they are out of stock of the burgundy carpet bob shows no care telling her to choose the carpet with her being lost in what he means it showed the difference between the two as bob realised his life was unhealthy but his wife doesnt seem to understand or listen to him too distracted by the world around her the exact same thing happens to charlotte as she calls a friend trying to explain her loss of self and struggles in her marriage to a friend for them not to listen whats important about bob and charlottes relationship is they listen to eachother with the scene where the romantic couple would usually consummate saw them just talking with charlotte talking about her confusion on what to do and bob telling her to keep writing reassuring her hes confident that whatever she does she will be ok it does make me laugh that i have only got around to just watching this film now with every time someone tells me to watch it i always say im too busy but maybe thats something coppola was aiming for  one thing that did wrong i think was the comedy through japans culture and people often leave them as the joke due to their language and often acting as caricatures such as that of the escort with his mispronunciation of rip and also of the photographer being unable to pronounce roger moore properly i think if you were japanese it could he seen as culturally insensitive to a certain degree and the joke ironically could be lost in translation as it seems like they are the runt of the joke i think this occurred due to coppola herself also being an outsider and therefore possibly not quite getting the culture herself with sometimes feeling like the film itself is alienated from the country its filmed in but i get thats the point to some degree as referred to earlier i think manhattan woody allen did a similar thing to this film but didnt cause the city to feel so alienated and so possibly did better job for me there i would wonder what this film would be like if it was filmed from a director from japan or possibly even tokyo im sure much of the humour wouldnt have been so western suited the film i think it would have probably ended up like fallen angels wong kar wai  overall lost in translation is a beautiful film it talks about some things so subtly which makes it so amazing but it is a very western and even more so american film in the way it deals with culture of other countries and i couldnt myself get behind it i found much of the comedy for me fell flat due to this i will have to come back to this film at some point when im not too busy  7510  where to watch it netflix subscription amazon rent of buy itunes rent or buy,105,31

#Bristruth26322,to continue the trend of bristruth26288  as a final year english lit student these are the definitive personality types of this species that i have observed  1 the zombies  you see them in lecture theatres and seminars but have no idea who they are effectively fleshy weights used to fill roomslectures but seem void of any signs of sentience they tend to look like the specific pool of people that are too good for love island but not good enough for made in chelsea theyre in their third year but still maintain a strong stoke bishop energy  2 the dodecahedrons these guys are so edgy they put the regular bristol cool kids to shame corduroy tweed berets faux fur baggy tshirts dms filas flares whatever the trend it definitely started here theres an aspirational bob dylan vibe within this group of people that perhaps somewhat unachieved is pretty charming and at the very least theyve always got filters handy  3 the smart ones a small group of people that actually manage to finish all of the set reading and actually speak during seminars everyone hates them a little bit because they clearly wank to the sound of their own voice but really were all a little relieved when they walk though the door because it means we can all hide behind their massive egos they can be terrible or great most of them consider themselves modern day simone de beauvoirs and satres they are perhaps something closer to rupi kaur  4 the private school ones probably the most vapid were it not for the zombies these ones can be loud and use long words like dodecahedron they probably had a great english teacher in sixth form where they studied ulysses and thought they were living in a real life dead poets society however upon coming to university realised that they didnt really care for english too much and have more often than not read absolutely nothing they have an aura that suggests they kinda miss the empire it is sometimes hard to distinguish between this type of student and the smart one as they are both good at bullshitting a good way to determine which is which the private school ones can exclusively be found in bargs every other night  5 the other 30 these guys are just pretty normal sweet smart people the kind youd be relieved to have in a group presentation diligently read the books and do well without boasting youll find yourself thinking i wonder why were not really good friends then you remember theyre mindnumbingly boring  6 and last but certainly not least the poets these tortured artists can often be found scribbling down lines of poetry with knitted brows as they wonder which one would be best to send to helicon you might see them sitting across from you in lifedrawing or getting arrested at that xr protest yeah theyre a little bit cliched but theyre pretty fit so you go along with their whims anyway all this aside you could probably see them voting tory in 20 years time,47,21

#Bristruth26302,i know there are loads of exam stress and mental health posts out there right now but i seriously cannot stress enough the importance of talking about whats going on in your mind with other people it doesnt matter who you are what you identify as or how old you are etc were all human with complex minds and while it is often tempting to run away from thoughts which seem like they shouldnt be there it is always best to talk about them rather than locking them away where they can fester and come back to haunt you even more these may be thoughts that have been around for years or maybe have just surfaced but honestly it is worth talking to friends family tutors doctors or anyone there is always something in what we so badly want to talk about that others can relate to and i know from experience that it is scary to let these thoughts out and feel the emotions that come with them but in the long term it is better to experience uncomfortable emotions in talking out your thoughts for a short time compared to fencing them in and ignoring them and hoping theyll go away only to have them haunt you more frequently liberate your minds and make your life easier were all human its good to talk and its ok not to be ok,29,0

#Bristruth25113,so on top of my demanding mathematics course i have been using my spare time to work on an independent research project i am now delighted to share it with you  title can mathematical modelling really help you lose your virginity  1 abstract  losing your virginity can be an excruciatingly difficult challenge for many unattractive or short or stinky or socially awkward guys i empathise greatly for this reason i have been motivated to find rigorous models which can aid one in attaining the holy grail of humanity  having sex  it had recently come to my attention that losing your virginity can essentially be viewed mathematically as a dynamical system one can use a system of ordinary differential equations to model the methods in which to convince a girl to have sex with you for the very first time  an example of a such a model could for arguments sake involve the following take time t as an independent variable we could then use equations involving variables c and h dependent on time representing compliments given to the girl and humourous remarks made in conversation respectively to give a suitable model  one can then analyse the solutions to such appropriate model note we are working with autonomous systems only in this project we aim for a system which provides asymptotically stable solutions  in laymans terms this means the following  when one initially approaches a girl and starts a conversation with her we are obviously starting a bit further away from the required solution which is of course having a hot steamy night of sexual passion in the bedroom we want to find a system of differential equations such that if we start in a position a bit further away from our goal as time goes on we move closer and closer and closer to our dream target  now of course we have to be consistent with the theory of ordinary differential equations  we can never officially touch the target solutions given an arbitrary starting point if we were to do that then that would suggest wed end up shagging the target girl for an infinite amount of time now unless youre an absolute total tank and beast in bed shagging for an infinite amount of time is impossible but once we get so close in our model  weve essential bagged that absolute stunner weve been looking for  on the other hand lyapunov stable solutions are undesirable you know the times when youre talking to girl and its going ok but that sexual spark just isnt kicking off  thats what this correlates to and of course unstable solutions are not on the cards  no one wants flat out rejections as soon as you say hi  2 finding the perfect model  i can confirm that finally i have found a perfect system which satisfies the required conditions necessary to get any girl to have sex with you in other words my virginity will be approaching its death very soon  now i cannot share this system equations and its variables with you  i would not like you to enjoy the sexual success and prowess that i am on the verge of embarking on but what i can share with you is a couple of initial conversational tips initial conditions that would certainly work for my dynamical system and would get you laid without a doubt but finding the correct dynamical system is up to you  initial condition 1 approach a girl and say hey sexy you are absolutely different gravy my darling lets have a taste of each other initial condition 2 approach a girl and say hey gorgeous i want hardcore sex with you so bad babe get in bed with me  given that you can devise the right model ive found that these conversation starters are guaranteed to get you that good old shag and rid you of that dreaded virginity that has plagued your life for so many years  3 conclusion  mathematics has come to the rescue once again it will help me  and you  lose that virginity i am so looking forward to implementing my new found methods from this week onwards  the results will be amazing  note wow im such a virgin if i dont get slapped in the face after trying this ill consider it a success ngl but this is what the maths has told me to do need to have faith in maths you know hopefully works see you soon beautiful ladies x,100,92

#Bristruth25059,a guide to some of the criticisms against jeremy corbyn   hes a terrorist sympathiser not just untrue but pretty much the opposite of true he won the gandhi award for promoting peace in northern ireland and elsewhere and was one of the mps to sign a letter actively condemning the bombings in birmingham the entirety of criticism in this regard comes from pictures of him with the sinn fein politicians gerry adams and martin mcguinness both of whom have also been pictured with the queen and prince charles because theyre politicians not terrorists  he doesnt care about defence he wont use the nuclear option also just straight untrue he has committed to using nuclear weapons as a retaliatory method if necessary but prefers systems of de escalation than a preemptive strike i can not comprehend how preferring diplomacy to murdering millions of civilians is a controversial policy  he doesnt tell us how hes going to pay for anything he just wants a magic money tree the labour manifesto from 2017 is costed and it is effectively the same as 2019s which is yet to be announced so you can have a look at how labour intends to pay for its policies if you can actually be bothered do you know whos manifesto isnt costed the conservatives  labour is antisemitic this is the best of a bad bunch of criticisms the home affairs select committee concluded that no reliable evidence to support the notion that antisemitism is any more prevalent in the labour party than in any other political party 008 of the members were found to have expressed anti semitic sentiments and were expelled in 2018 contrary to some opinion labour has also accepted without qualification the ihra definition and put in place a more expedient method for removing members who are accused of anti semitism im not saying that jewish people who have expressed concern are lying or wrong and i personally do think labour need to take stronger and more public measures but i do think people in the media with vested interests in compromising labour have distorted the facts to try and sway public opinion  according to an lse study only 11 of newspaper articles accurately represent jeremy corbyns views without qualification the highest being the guardian who manage to do it 27 of the time  if you arent voting labour for any of these reasons please reconsider and maybe ask yourself why the wealthy owners of so many news organisations feel threatened enough to lie about these things  austerity has killed 130000 people since 2012 the conservatives and lib dems voted for it do the right thing  some sourcesby no means comprehensive and i encourage you to do your own research  martin mcguinness with the queen httpsmindependentieirishnewshistoricmomentmartinmcguinnessandthequeenshookhands35550665html  lse study httpwwwlseacukmediaandcommunicationsresearchresearchprojectsrepresentationsofjeremycorbyn  anti semitism httpswwwparliamentukbusinesscommitteescommitteesazcommonsselecthomeaffairscommitteeinquiriesparliament2015inquiry2  httpswwwthejccomnewsuknewsjohnbercowiveexperiencedantisemitismmyselfjeremycorbynlabourhasabigissuetoaddress1492857  labour manifesto httpslabourorgukwpcontentuploads201710labourmanifesto2017pdf  gandhi award httpswwwgooglecoukampsgandhifoundationorg20140109thegandhifoundationinternationalpeaceaward2013amp  nuclear weapons httpsmyoutubecomwatchvcuitkrcr0i  deaths due to austerity httpswwwgooglecoukampsamptheguardiancompolitics2019jun01perfectstormausteritybehind130000deathsukipprreport,176,20

#Bristruth23582,here is my personal ranking of the three versions of no ordinary girl from h2o just add water  3 indiana evans season 3 now i know im going to get a lot of hate for this one considering indiana evans plays bella hartley on the show and everyone seems to like her for some reason ill admit the song is definitely the best produced and mastered version but overall i just find it extremely basic and neutral sounding positives include the big lead into the chorus and the nice use of adlibs whilst the negatives include a lack of power in indianas voice and the worst bridge of the three its way too short 510  2 ellie henderson season 1 a lot of people may feel as though this one is the best because it was the original im not going to base my opinion on this fact alone ellie has the best voice of the three and the song carries a quick tempo allowing it to sound much more exciting than indianas also i really like the giiiirlll part if you know you know however the song suffers from a really long guitar rift which doesnt really fit and there is a very limited use of instruments and production 710  1 kate alexa season 2 this is it this is the only version of these songs i can get up and dance to it has the best bridge the biggest lead into the chorus and has a really edgy rock vibe whilst kate does appear to have the worst voice of the three it isnt really needed to carry the rest of the song 910 imagine if ellie sung on this version wooow,39,30

#Bristruth23502,overseas student from hong kong as many of you might be aware of there was a huge protest in hong kong more than 1 million people went out and protested against the extradition law amendment bill elab about 17th of the population in hong kong the reason why many people were against it was because with the bill passes the chinese government could extradite any fugitives that committed felony in china when hong kong was under the british regime the established common law system was intended to have a barrier between the us and the chinese legal system as china has been known for not having fair legal system many people in china were arrested based on their political point of view and yet were charged with another irrelevant crime eg ai weiwei  tax evasion  officials in hong kong are now pushing the elab to pass this wednesday with that enacted chinese government would be able to lawfully prosecute anyone who speak against the authority all they need is just creativity and think of a crime to legally extradite that person it deeply erodes the freedom of speech and protest in my opinion people can no longer speak up for anything they feel unjust about the society nor will they be able to have a government that represents the people  what i am furious the most is that those officials are all overseas passport holders or permanent residence especially england it means that after treading the basic rights of people in hong kong and when they retired they could enjoy a luxurious retirement life in england or elsewhere in the world without bearing any consequences  i am not intended to bring up any debates in this post all i would like to do is to share my point of view as a hongkonger and remind the fellow members in bristruth that democracy is only precious when it is lost or eroded by power and authority i was reading 1984 when i did gcse i considered that as a political fiction describing a dystopia state and i swear to god i have never thought of that to becoming real now when i read the fiction again and looking at hong kong i cant really tell the difference between them  thank you for your time reading this and may god bless the queen and hong kong,209,15

#Bristruth22914,bristruth22839  i dont know why it is that these things bother me  it just makes me picture a seven year old first discovering things about an animal and having no context about the subject ranting about how stupid they are i get its a joke but people take it as an actual educational joke like its a man yelling at the sea and thats just wrong furthermore these things have an actual impact on discussions about conservation efforts  if every time koalas get brought up someone posts this shit that means its seriously shaping public opinion about the animal and their supposed lack of importance  speaking of stupidity and food one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous eucalyptus leaves the only thing they eat have almost no nutritional value  nonecologists always talk this way and the problem is youre looking at this backwards  an entire continent is covered with eucalyptus trees they suck the moisture out of the entire surrounding area and use allelopathy to ensure that most of whats beneath them is just bare red dust no animal is making use of themthey have virtually no herbivore predator a niche is empty then inevitably natural selection fills that niche by creating an animal which can eat eucalyptus leaves of course it takes great sacrifice for it to be able to do soit certainly cant expend much energy on costly things isnt it a good thing that a niche is being filled  they have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal  its pretty typical of herbivores and is higher than many many species according to ashwell 2008 their encephalisation quotient is 05288  0051 higher than comparable marsupials like the wombat 052 some possums 0468 cuscus 0462 and even some wallabies are 05 according to wiki rabbits are also around 04 and theyre placental mammals  additionally their brains are smooth a brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons  again this is not unique to koalas brain folds gyri are not present in rodents which we consider to be incredibly intelligent for their size  if you present a koala with leaves plucked from a fucking branch laid on a flat fucking surface the koala will not recognise it as food  if you present a human with a random piece of meat they will not recognise it as food hopefully fresh leaves might be important for koala digestion especially since their gut flora is clearly important for the digestion of eucalyptus it might make sense not to screw with that gut flora by eating decaying leaves  because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end unlike their brains they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal  thats an extremely weird reason to dislike an animal but whilst were talking about their digestion lets discuss their poop its delightful it smells like a eucalyptus drop,21,2
#Bristruth22901,think its a bit ridiculous that people see being antiisrael is seen as being antisemitic i fully support the jewish community but condemn how israel wiped out a whole country to the point of palestine not being internationally recognised its a humanitarian issue and a severe injustice and wanting justice for palestinians does not mean a hatred of jewish people it means we want to hold the israeli government to account of what they did and the other parties involved,130,20

#Bristruth19469,to the guy i got with in lolas on tuesday night here is how you perpetuate rape culture   1 you informed me that if you bought me a drink i would owe you a kiss i bought my own drink 2 you legitimately used the phrase youre mine now as well as youre so sexy i might not be able to help myself 3 despite me clearly looking uncomfortable and pulling away you continued to kiss my neck and try to get me to touch you 4 after telling you numerous times that i did not want to go home with you you followed my friend and i to the chip shop expecting me to change my mind 5 you informed me that you would not leave the chip shop until i gave you my snapchat because i was too sexy my friend and i decided to be the ones to leave the chip shop instead  despite telling you after incident 1 why your behaviour was problematic you continued to behave in the exact same way that i even had cause in the first place to have to explain to you why this behaviour makes a person uncomfortable is quite frankly ridiculous that i am having to explain for a second time because you clearly didnt get the message is inconvenient frustrating and should be unnecessary but evidently isnt  consent is not difficult to understand but lets break it down for your small mind so that hopefully the next woman doesnt have to  the basics first as you dont even seem to have a grasp of these  saying nothing is not consent  a yes is required for consent  a person can consent and then change their mind  consenting once to one kiss is not consent to future kisses or other physical and sexual acts see 3 nor does it permit you to continually ask for sex after the person refused the first time see 4 trying to change someones mind after they have said no means that the required culture of consent is nonexistent  buying a person something such as a drink or giving a favourproviding a service does not mean that that person owes you a sexual act in return see 1  you cannot exchange a drink for control over another persons body  being attracted to someone again does not give you the right to their body or the right to contact them see 2  5 i am not yours i am not an object for you to possess saying that you cant help yourself because you are attracted to me is not a compliment it is a nod to rape  surely this is just fucking logic  sincerely a student who is tired of having to constantly repeat herself,1094,12
